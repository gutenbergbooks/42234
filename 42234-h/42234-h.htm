<h2>THE PREFACE</h2>

<p class="noi"><cite>Preaching of Sermons is Speaking to a few of Mankind: Printing
of Books is Talking to the whole World. The Parson Prescribes
himself, and addresses to the particular Auditory with the Appellation
of</cite> My Brethren; <cite>but he that Prints a Book, ought to
Preface it with a</cite> Noverint Universi, <cite>Know all Men by these
Presents</cite>.</p>

<p><em>The proper Inference drawn from this remarkable Observation,
is, That tho' he that Preaches from the Pulpit ought to be
careful of his Words, that nothing pass from him but with an
especial Sanction of Truth; yet he that Prints and Publishes to
all the World, has a tenfold Obligation.</em></p>

<p><em>The Sermon is a Sound of Words spoken to the Ear, and
prepar'd only for present Meditation, and extends no farther
than the strength of Memory can convey it; a Book Printed is a
Record; remaining in every Man's Possession, always ready to
renew its Acquaintance with his Memory, and always ready to
be produc'd as an Authority or Voucher to any Reports he
makes out of it, and conveys its Contents for Ages to come, to
the Eternity of mortal Time, when the Author is forgotten in his
Grave.</em></p>

<p><em>If a Sermon be ill grounded, if the Preacher imposes upon us,
he trespasses on a few; but if a Book Printed obtrudes a Falshood,
if a Man tells a Lye in Print, he abuses Mankind, and
imposes upon the whole World, he causes our Children to tell
Lyes after us, and their Children after them, to the End of the
World.</em></p>

<p><em>This Observation I thought good to make by way of Preface,
to let the World know, that when I go about a Work in which I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>must tell a great many Stories, which may in their own nature
seem incredible, and in which I must expect a great part of
Mankind will question the Sincerity of the Relator; I did not do
it without a particular sence upon me of the proper Duty of an
Historian, and the abundant Duty laid on him to be very wary
what he conveys to Posterity.</em></p>

<p><em>I cannot be so ignorant of my own Intentions, as not to know,
that in many Cases I shall act the Divine, and draw necessary
practical Inferences from the extraordinary Remarkables of this
Book, and some Digressions which I hope may not be altogether
useless in this Case.</em></p>

<p><em>And while I pretend to a thing so solemn, I cannot but premise
I should stand convicted of a double Imposture, to forge a Story,
and then preach Repentance to the Reader from a Crime greater
than that I would have him repent of: endeavouring by a Lye to
correct the Reader's Vices, and sin against Truth to bring the
Reader off from sinning against Sence.</em></p>

<p><em>Upon this score, tho' the Undertaking be very difficult among
such an infinite variety of Circumstances, to keep, exactly within
the bounds of Truth; yet I have this positive Assurance with me,
that in all the subsequent Relation, if the least Mistake happen,
it shall not be mine.</em></p>

<p><em>If I judge right, 'Tis the Duty of an Historian to set every
thing in its own Light, and to convey matter of fact upon its
legitimate Authority, and no other: I mean thus, (for I wou'd be
as explicit as I can) That where a Story is vouch'd to him with
sufficient Authority, he ought to give the World the Special
Testimonial of its proper Voucher, or else he is not just to the
Story: and where it comes without such sufficient Authority, he
ought to say so; otherwise he is not just to himself. In the first
Case he injures the History, by leaving it doubtful where it might
be confirm'd past all manner of question; in the last he injures
his own Reputation, by taking upon himself the Risque, in case
it proves a Mistake, of having the World charge him with a
Forgery.</em></p>

<p><em>And indeed, I cannot but own 'tis just, that if I tell a Story in
Print for a Truth which proves otherwise, unless I, at the same
time, give proper Caution to the Reader, by owning the Uncertainty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>of my Knowledge in the matter of fact, 'tis I impose upon
the World: my Relater is innocent, and the Lye is my own.</em></p>

<p><em>I make all these preliminary Observations, partly to inform
the Reader, that I have not undertaken this Work without the
serious Consideration of what I owe to Truth, and to Posterity;
nor without a Sence of the extraordinary Variety and Novelty
of the Relation.</em></p>

<p><em>I am sensible, that the want of this Caution is the Foundation
of that great Misfortune we have in matters of ancient History;
in which the Impudence, the Ribaldry, the empty Flourishes,
the little Regard to Truth, and the Fondness of telling a strange
Story, has dwindled a great many valuable Pieces of ancient
History into meer Romance.</em></p>

<p><em>How are the Lives of some of our most famous Men, nay the
Actions of whole Ages, drowned in Fable? Not that there wanted
Pen-men to write, but that their Writings were continually
mixt with such Rhodomontades of the Authors that Posterity
rejected them as fabulous.</em></p>

<p><em>From hence it comes to pass that Matters of Fact are handed
down to Posterity with so little Certainty, that nothing is to be
depended upon; from hence the uncertain Account of Things
and Actions in the remoter Ages of the World, the confounding
the Genealogies as well as Atchievements of</em> Belus, Nimrod, <em>and</em>
Nimrus, <em>and their Successors, the Histories and Originals of</em>
Saturn, Jupiter, <em>and the rest of the Celestial Rabble, who
Mankind would have been asham'd to have call'd</em> Gods, <em>had
they had the true Account of their dissolute, exorbitant, and
inhumane Lives</em>.</p>

<p><em>From Men we may descend to Action: and this prodigious
Looseness of the Pen has confounded History and Fable from
the beginning of both. Thus the great Flood in</em> Deucalion'<em>s</em>
Time <em>is made to pass for the Universal Deluge: the Ingenuity
of</em> Dedalus, <em>who by a Clue of Thread got out of the</em> Egyptian
<em>Maze, which was thought impossible, is grown into a Fable of
making himself a pair of Wings, and flying through the Air:&mdash;the
great Drought and violent Heat of Summer, thought to be
the Time when the Great Famine was in</em> Samaria, <em>fabl'd by the
Poets and Historians into the Story of</em> Phaeton <em>borrowing the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>Chariot of the Sun, and giving the Horses their Heads, they run
so near the Earth as burnt up all the nearest Parts, and scorch'd
the Inhabitants, so that they have been black in those Parts ever
since.</em></p>

<p><em>These, and such like ridiculous Stuff, have been the Effects of
the Pageantry of Historians in former Ages: and I might descend
nearer home, to the Legends of Fabulous History which have
swallow'd up the Actions of our ancient Predecessors, King</em>
Arthur, <em>the Gyant</em> Gogmagog, <em>and the</em> Britain, <em>the Stories of
St.</em> George <em>and the</em> Dragon, Guy <em>Earl of</em> Warwick, Bevis <em>of</em>
Southampton, <em>and the like</em>.</p>

<p><em>I'll account for better Conduct in the ensuing History: and
tho' some Things here related shall have equal Wonder due to
them, Posterity shall not have equal Occasion to distrust the
Verity of the Relation.</em></p>

<p><em>I confess here is room for abundance of Romance, because
the Subject may be safer extended than in any other case, no
Story being capable to be crowded with such Circumstances,
but Infinite Power, which is all along concern'd with us in every
Relation, is suppos'd capable of making true.</em></p>

<p><em>Yet we shall no where so Trespass upon Fact, as to oblige
Infinite Power to the shewing more Miracles than it intended.</em></p>

<p><em>It must be allow'd, That when Nature was put into so much
Confusion, and the Surface of the Earth and Sea felt such
extraordinary a Disorder, innumerable Accidents would fall out
that till the like Occasion happen may never more be seen, and
unless a like Occasion had happen'd could never before be heard
of: wherefore the particular Circumstances being so wonderful,
serve but to remember Posterity of the more wonderful Extreme,
which was the immediate Cause.</em></p>

<p><em>The Uses and Application made from this Terrible Doctrine,
I leave to the Men of the Pulpit; only take the freedom to
observe, that when Heaven it self lays down the Doctrine, all
Men are summon'd to make Applications by themselves.</em></p>

<p><em>The main Inference I shall pretend to make or at least venture
the exposing to publick View, in this case, is, the strong Evidence
God has been pleas'd to give in this terrible manner to his own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>Being, which Mankind began more than ever to affront and
despise: And I cannot but have so much Charity for the worst
of my Fellow-Creatures, that I believe no Man was so hard'ned
against the Sence of his Maker, but he felt some Shocks of his
wicked Confidence from the Convulsions of Nature at this time.</em></p>

<p><em>I cannot believe any Man so rooted in Atheistical Opinions,
as not to find some Cause to doubt whether he was not in the
Wrong, and a little to apprehend the Possibility of a Supreme
Being, when he felt the terrible Blasts of this Tempest. I cannot
doubt but the Atheist's hard'ned Soul trembl'd a little as well as
his House, and he felt some Nature asking him some little
Questions; as these</em>&mdash;Am not I mistaken? Certainly there is
some such thing as a God&mdash;What can all this be? What is the
Matter in the World?</p>

<p><em>Certainly Atheism is one of the most Irrational Principles in
the World; there is something incongruous in it with the Test of
Humane Policy, because there is a Risque in the Mistake one
way, and none another. If the Christian is mistaken, and it
should at last appear that there is no Future State, God or Devil,
Reward or Punishment, where is the Harm of it? All he has lost
is, that he has practis'd a few needless Mortifications, and took
the pains to live a little more like a Man than he wou'd have
done. But if the Atheist is mistaken, he has brought all the
Powers, whose Being he deny'd, upon his Back, has provok'd
the Infinite in the highest manner, and must at last sink under
the Anger of him whose Nature he has always disown'd.</em></p>

<p><em>I would recommend this Thought to any Man to consider of,
one Way he can lose nothing, the other he may be undone.
Certainly a wise Man would never run such an unequal Risque:
a Man cannot answer it to Common Arguments, the Law of
Numbers, and the Rules of Proportion are against him. No
Gamester will set at such a Main; no Man will lay such a Wager,
where he may lose, but cannot win.</em></p>

<p><em>There is another unhappy Misfortune in the Mistake too, that
it can never be discover'd till 'tis too late to remedy. He that
resolves to die an Atheist, shuts the Door against being convinc'd
in time.</em></p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
<span class="i0"><em>If it shou'd so fall out, as who can tell,</em><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>But that there is a God, a Heaven, and Hell,</em><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>Mankind had best consider well for Fear,</em><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>'t should be too late when his Mistakes appear.</em><br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p><em>I should not pretend to set up for an Instructor in this Case,
were not the Inference so exceeding just; who can but preach
where there is such a Text? when God himself speaks his own
Power, he expects we should draw just Inferences from it, both
for our Selves and our Friends.</em></p>

<p><em>If one Man, in an Hundred Years, shall arrive at a Conviction
of the Being of his Maker, 'tis very well worth my While to write
it, and to bear the Character of an impertinent Fellow from all
the rest.</em></p>

<p><em>I thought to make some Apology for the Meanness of Stile,
and the Method, which may be a little unusual, of Printing
Letters from the Country in their own Stile.</em></p>

<p><em>For the last I only leave this short Reason with the Reader,
the Desire I had to keep close to the Truth, and hand my
Relation with the true Authorities from whence I receiv'd it;
together with some Justice to the Gentlemen concern'd, who,
especially in Cases of Deliverances, are willing to record the
Testimonial of the Mercies they received, and to set their Hands
to the humble Acknowledgement. The Plainness and Honesty
of the Story will plead for the Meanness of the Stile in many of
the Letters, and the Reader cannot want Eyes to see what sort
of People some of them come from.</em></p>

<p><em>Others speak for themselves, and being writ by Men of Letters,
as well as Men of Principles, I have not Arrogance enough
to attempt a Correction either of the Sense or Stile; and if I had
gone about it, should have injur'd both Author and Reader.</em></p>

<p><em>These come dressed in their own Words because I ought not,
and those because I could not mend 'em. I am perswaded, they
are all dress'd in the desirable, though unfashionable Garb
of Truth, and I doubt not but Posterity will read them with
Pleasure.</em></p>

<p><em>The Gentlemen, who have taken the Pains to collect and
transmit the Particular Relations here made publick, I hope will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>have their End answered in this Essay, conveying hereby to the
Ages to come the Memory of the dreadfulest and most universal
Judgment that ever Almighty Power thought fit to bring upon
this Part of the World.</em></p>

<p><em>And as this was the true Native and Original Design of the
first Undertaking, abstracted from any Part of the Printer's
Advantage, the Editor and Undertakers of this Work, having
their Ends entirely answer'd, hereby give their humble Thanks
to all those Gentlemen who have so far approv'd the Sincerity
of their Design as to contribute their Trouble, and help forward
by their just Observations, the otherwise very difficult Undertaking.</em></p>

<p><em>If Posterity will but make the desired Improvement both of
the Collector's Pains, as well as the several Gentlemens Care in
furnishing the Particulars, I dare say they will all acknowledge
their End fully answer'd, and none more readily than</em></p>

<h2>THE STORM</h2>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="subtitle"><em>Of the Natural Causes and Original of Winds</em></p>

<p class="noi">Though a System of Exhalation, Dilation, and Extension, things
which the Ancients founded the Doctrine of Winds upon, be
not my direct Business; yet it cannot but be needful to the present
Design to Note, that the Difference in the Opinions of the
Ancients, about the Nature and Original of Winds, is a Leading
Step to one Assertion which I have advanc'd in all that I have
said with Relation to Winds, <em>viz.</em> That there seems to be more
of God in the whole Appearance, than in any other Part of
Operating Nature.</p>

<p>Nor do I think I need explain my self very far in this Notion:
I allow the high Original of Nature to be the Great Author of
all her Actings, and by the strict Rein of his Providence, is the
Continual and Exact Guide of her Executive Power; but still 'tis
plain that in Some of the Principal Parts of Nature she is Naked
to our Eye, Things appear both in their Causes and Consequences,
Demonstration gives its Assistance, and finishes our
further Enquiries: for we never enquire after God in those Works
of Nature which depending upon the Course of Things are plain
and demonstrative; but where we find Nature defective in her
Discovery, where we see Effects but cannot reach their Causes;
there 'tis most just, and Nature her self seems to direct us to it,
to end the rational Enquiry, and resolve it into Speculation:
Nature plainly refers us beyond her Self, to the Mighty Hand of
Infinite Power, the Author of Nature, and Original of all Causes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
Among these Arcana of the Sovereign Oeconomy, the Winds
are laid as far back as any. Those Ancient Men of Genius who
rifled Nature by the Torch-Light of Reason even to her very
Nudities, have been run a-ground in this unknown Channel; the
Wind has blown out the Candle of Reason, and left them all in
the Dark.</p>

<p><em>Aristotle</em>, in his Problems, Sect. 23. calls the Wind <cite>Aeris
Impulsum</cite>. <em>Seneca</em> says, <cite>Ventus est Aer Fluens</cite>. The <em>Stoicks</em> held
it, <cite>Motum aut Fluxionem Aeris</cite>. Mr. <em>Hobs</em>, Air mov'd in a
direct or undulating Motion. Fournier, <cite>Le Vent et un Movement
Agitation de l'Air Causi par des Exhalations et Vapours</cite>. The
Moderns, a Hot and Dry Exhalation repuls'd by Antiperistasis;
<em>Des Cartes</em> defines it, <cite>Venti Nihil sunt nisi Moti &amp; Dilati
Vapores</cite>. And various other Opinions are very judiciously
collected by the Learned Mr. <em>Bohun</em> in his Treatise of the
Origin and Properties of Wind, P. 7. and concludes, '<cite>That no
one Hypothesis, how Comprehensive soever, has yet been able
to resolve all the Incident Phenomena of Winds</cite>. Bohun <cite>of
Winds</cite>, P. 9.</p>

<p>This is what I quote them for, and this is all my Argument
demands; the deepest Search into the Region of Cause and
Consequence, has found out just enough to leave the wisest
Philosopher in the dark, to bewilder his Head, and drown his
Understanding. You raise a Storm in Nature by the very Inquiry;
and at last, to be rid of you, she confesses the Truth, and tells
you, <em>It is not in Me, you must go Home and ask my Father</em>.</p>

<p>Whether then it be the Motion of Air, and what that Air is,
<em>which as yet is undefin'd</em>, whether it is a Dilation, a previous
Contraction, and then violent Extension as in Gun-Powder,
whether the Motion is Direct, Circular, or Oblique, whether
it be an Exhalation repuls'd by the Middle Region, and the
Antiperistasis of that Part of the Heavens which is set as a Wall
of Brass to bind up the Atmosphere, and keep it within its proper
Compass for the Functions of Respiration, Condensing and
Rarifying, without which Nature would be all in Confusion;
whatever are their efficient Causes, 'tis not much to the immediate
Design.</p>

<p>'Tis apparent, that God Almighty, whom the Philosophers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>care as little as possible to have any thing to do with, seems to
have reserv'd this, as one of those Secrets in Nature which
should more directly guide them to himself.</p>

<p>Not but that a Philosopher may be a Christian, and some of
the best of the Latter have been the best of the Former, as
<em>Vossius</em>, Mr. <em>Boyle</em>, Sir <em>Walter Raleigh</em>, Lord <em>Verulam</em>, Dr.
<em>Harvey</em>, and others; and I wish I could say Mr. <em>Hobbs</em>, for 'twas
Pity there should lie any just Exceptions to the Piety of a Man,
who had so few to his General Knowledge, and an exalted Spirit
in Philosophy.</p>

<p>When therefore I say the Philosophers do not care to concern
God himself in the Search after Natural Knowledge; I mean, as
it concerns Natural Knowledge, <em>meerly as such</em>; for 'tis a Natural
Cause they seek, from a General Maxim, That all Nature has
its Cause within it self: 'tis true, 'tis the Darkest Part of the
Search, to trace the Chain backward; to begin at the Consequence,
and from thence <em>hunt Counter</em>, as we may call it, to
find out the Cause: 'twould be much easier if we could begin at
the Cause, and trace it to all its Consequences.</p>

<p>I make no Question, the Search would be equally to the
Advantage of Science, and the Improvement of the World; for
without Doubt there are some Consequences of known Causes
which are not yet discover'd, and I am as ready to believe there
are yet in Nature some <em>Terra Incognita</em> both as to Cause and
Consequence too.</p>

<p>In this Search after Causes, the Philosopher, tho' he may at
the same Time be a very good Christian, cares not at all to
meddle with his Maker: the Reason is plain; We may at any
time resolve all things into Infinite Power, and we do allow that
the Finger of Infinite is the First Mighty Cause of Nature her
self: but the Treasury of Immediate Cause is generally committed
to Nature; and if at any Time we are driven to look beyond her,
'tis because we are out of the way: 'tis not because it is not in
her, but because we cannot find it.</p>

<p>Two Men met in the Middle of a great Wood; One was
searching for a Plant which grew in the Wood, the Other had
lost himself in the Wood, and wanted to get out: The Latter
rejoyc'd when thro' the Trees he saw the open Country: but the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>Other Man's Business was not to get out, but to find what he
look'd for: yet this Man no more undervalued the Pleasantness
of the Champion Country than the other.</p>

<p>Thus in Nature the Philosopher's Business is not to look
through Nature, and come to the vast open Field of Infinite
Power; his Business is in the Wood; there grows the Plant he
looks for; and 'tis there he must find it. Philosophy's a-ground
if it is forc'd to any further Enquiry. The Christian begins just
where the Philosopher ends; and when the Enquirer turns his
Eyes up to Heaven, Farewel Philosopher; 'tis a Sign he can make
nothing of it here.</p>

<p><em>David</em> was a good Man, the Scripture gives him that Testimony;
but I am of the Opinion, he was a better King than a
Scholar, more a Saint than a Philosopher: and it seems very
proper to judge that <em>David</em> was upon the Search of Natural
Causes, and found himself puzzled as to the Enquiry, when he
finishes the Enquiry with two pious Ejaculations, <cite>When I view
the Heavens the Works of thy Hands, the Moon and the Stars
which thou hast made; then I say, what is Man</cite>! <em>David</em> may
very rationally be suppos'd to be searching the Causes, Motions,
and Influences of Heavenly Bodies; and finding his Philosophy
a-ground, and the Discovery not to answer his Search, he turns
it all to a pious Use, recognizes Infinite Power, and applies it to
the Exstasies and Raptures of his Soul, which were always
employ'd in the Charm of exalted Praise.</p>

<p>Thus in another Place we find him dissecting the Womb of
his Mother, and deep in the Study of Anatomy; but having, as
it may be well supposed, no Help from <em>Johan Remelini</em>, or of
the Learned <cite>Riolanus</cite>, and other Anatomists, famous for the
most exquisite Discovery of human Body, and all the Vessels of
Life, with their proper Dimensions and Use, all <em>David</em> could say
to the Matter was, <em>Good Man</em>, to look up to Heaven, and
admire what he could not understand, <cite>Psal.&mdash;I was fearfully
and wonderfully made</cite>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>This is very Good, and well becomes a Pulpit; but what's all
this to a Philosopher? 'Tis not enough for him to know that
God has made the Heavens, the Moon, and the Stars, but must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>inform himself where he has plac'd them, and why there; and
what their Business, what their Influences, their Functions, and
the End of their Being. 'Tis not enough for an Anatomist to
know that he is fearfully and wonderfully made in the lowermost
Part of the Earth, but he must see those lowermost Parts; search
into the Method Nature proceeds upon in the performing the
Office appointed, must search the Steps she takes, the Tools she
works by; and in short, know all that the God of Nature has
permitted to be capable of Demonstration.</p>

<p>And it seems a just Authority for our Search, that some things
are so plac'd in Nature by a Chain of Causes and Effects, that
upon a diligent Search we may find out what we look for: To
search after what God has in his Sovereignty thought fit to
conceal, may be criminal, and doubtless is so; and the Fruitlesness
of the Enquiry is generally Part of the Punishment to a
vain Curiosity: but to search after what our Maker has not hid,
only cover'd with a thin Veil of Natural Obscurity, and which
upon our Search is plain to be read, seems to be justified by the
very Nature of the thing, and the Possibility of the Demonstration
is an Argument to prove the Lawfulness of the Enquiry.</p>

<p>The Design of this Digression, is, in short, That as where
Nature is plain to be search'd into, and Demonstration easy, the
Philosopher is allow'd to seek for it; so where God has, as it
were, laid his Hand upon any Place, and Nature presents us
with an universal Blank, we are therein led as naturally to
recognize the Infinite Wisdom and Power of the God of Nature,
as <em>David</em> was in the Texts before quoted.</p>

<p>And this is the Case here; the Winds are some of those Inscrutables
of Nature, in which humane Search has not yet been able
to arrive at any Demonstration.</p>

<p>'The Winds,' <em>says the Learned Mr.</em> Bohun, 'are generated in
the Intermediate Space between the Earth and the Clouds, either
by Rarefaction or Repletion, and sometimes haply by pressure
of Clouds, Elastical Virtue of the Air, &amp;c. from the Earth or
Seas, as by Submarine or Subterraneal Eruption or Descension
or Resilition from the middle Region.'</p>

<p>All this, though no Man is more capable of the Enquiry than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>this Gentleman, yet to the Demonstration of the thing, amounts
to no more than what we had before, and still leaves it as
Abstruse and Cloudy to our Understanding as ever.</p>

<p>Not but that I think my self bound in Duty to Science in
General, to pay a just Debt to the Excellency of Philosophical
Study, in which I am a meer Junior, and hardly any more
than an Admirer; and therefore I cannot but allow that the
Demonstrations made of Rarefaction and Dilatation are extraordinary;
and that by Fire and Water Wind may be rais'd in a
close Room, as the Lord <em>Verulam</em> made Experiment in the Case
of his Feathers.</p>

<p>But that therefore all the Causes of Wind are from the Influences
of the Sun upon vaporous Matter first Exhal'd, which
being Dilated are oblig'd to possess themselves of more Space
than before, and consequently make the Particles fly before
them; this does not seem to be a sufficient Demonstration of
Wind: for this, to my weak Apprehension, would rather make
a Blow like Gun-Powder than a rushing forward; at best this is
indeed a probable Conjecture, but admits not of Demonstration
equal to other Phænomena in Nature.</p>

<p>And this is all I am upon, <em>viz.</em> That this Case has not equal
Proofs of the Natural Causes of it that we meet with in other
Cases: The Scripture seems to confirm this, when it says in one
Place, <cite>He holds the Wind in his Hand</cite>; as if he should mean,
Other things are left to the Common Discoveries of Natural
Inquiry, but this is a thing he holds in his own Hand, and has
conceal'd it from the Search of the most Diligent and Piercing
Understanding: This is further confirm'd by the Words of our
Saviour, <cite>The Wind blows where it listeth, and thou hearest the
Sound thereof, but knowest not whence it cometh</cite>; 'tis plainly
express'd to signify that the Causes of the Wind are not equally
discover'd by Natural Enquiry as the rest of Nature is.</p>

<p>If I would carry this Matter on, and travel into the Seas, and
Mountains of <em>America</em>, where the Mansones, the Trade-Winds,
the Sea-Breezes, and such Winds as we have little Knowledge
of, are more common; it would yet more plainly appear,
<em>That we hear the Sound, but know not from whence they come.</em></p>

<p>Nor is the Cause of their Motion parallel to the Surface of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>Earth, a less Mystery than their real Original, or the Difficulty
of their Generation: and though some People have been forward
to prove the Gravity of the Particles must cause the Motion to
be oblique; 'tis plain it must be very little so, or else Navigation
would be impracticable, and in extroardinary Cases where the
Pressure above is perpendicular, it has been fatal to Ships,
Houses, <em>&amp;c.</em> and would have terrible Effects in the World, if it
should more frequently be so.</p>

<p>From this I draw only this Conclusion, That the Winds are a
Part of the Works of God by Nature, in which he has been
pleased to communicate less of Demonstration to us than in
other Cases; that the Particulars more directly lead us to Speculations,
and refer us to Infinite Power more than the other Parts
of Nature does.</p>

<p>That the Wind is more expressive and adapted to his Immediate
Power, as he is pleas'd to exert it in extraordinary Cases in
the World.</p>

<p>That 'tis more frequently made use of as the Executioner
of his Judgments in the World, and extraordinary Events are
brought to pass by it.</p>

<p>From these three Heads we are brought down directly to
speak of the Particular Storm before us; <em>viz.</em> The Greatest, the
Longest in Duration, the widest in Extent, of all the Tempests
and Storms that History gives any Account of since the Beginning
of Time.</p>

<p>In the further Conduct of the Story, 'twill not be foreign to
the Purpose, nor unprofitable to the Reader, to review the
Histories of ancient Time and remote Countries, and examine
in what Manner God has been pleas'd to execute his Judgments
by Storms and Tempests; what kind of things they have been,
and what the Consequences of them; and then bring down the
Parallel to the Dreadful Instance before us.</p>

<p>We read in the Scripture of Two Great Storms; One past, and
the Other to come. Whether the last be not Allegorical rather
than Prophetical, I shall not busie my self to determine.</p>

<p>The First was when God caused a strong Wind to blow upon
the Face of the Delug'd World; to put a stop to the Flood, and
reduce the Waters to their proper Channel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
I wish our Naturalists would explain that Wind to us, and
tell us which way it blew, or how it is possible that any direct
Wind could cause the Waters to ebb; for to me it seems, that the
Deluge being universal, that Wind which blew the Waters from
one Part must blow them up in another.</p>

<p>Whether it was not some perpendicular Gusts that might by
their Force separate the Water and the Earth, and cause the
Water driven from off the Land to <em>subside</em> by its own Pressure.</p>

<p>I shall dive no farther into that mysterious Deluge, which has
some things in it which recommend the Story rather to our Faith
than Demonstration.</p>

<p>The Other Storm I find in the Scripture is in the <cite>God shall
rain upon the Wicked, Plagues, Fire, and a horrible Tempest</cite>.
What this shall be, we wait to know; and happy are they who
shall be secured from its Effects.</p>

<p>Histories are full of Instances of violent Tempests and Storms
in sundry particular Places. What that was, which mingled with
such violent Lightnings set the Cities of <em>Sodom</em> and <em>Gomorrah</em>
on fire, remains to me yet undecided: nor am I satisfied the
Effect it had on the Waters of the Lake, which are to this Day
call'd the <em>Dead Sea</em>, are such as some fabulous Authors have
related, and as Travellers take upon them to say.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="subtitle"><em>Of the Opinion of the Ancients, That this Island was
more Subject to Storms than other Parts of the World</em></p>

<p class="noi">I am not of Opinion with the early Ages of the World, when
these Islands were first known, that they were the most Terrible
of any Part of the World for Storms and Tempests.</p>

<p><em>Cambden</em> tells us, The <em>Britains</em> were distinguish'd from all
the World by unpassable Seas and terrible Northern Winds,
which made the <em>Albion</em> Shores dreadful to Sailors; and this part
of the World was therefore reckoned the utmost Bounds of the
Northern known Land, beyond which none had ever sailed: and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>quotes a great variety of ancient Authors to this purpose; some
of which I present as a Specimen.</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2"><em>Et Penitus Toto Divisos Orbe Britannos.</em><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>Britain's</em> disjoyn'd from all the well known World.<br /></span>
<span class="i4"><em>Quem Littus adusta,</em><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>Horrescit Lybiæ, ratibusq; Impervia</em> *Thule
<span class="sidenote">*Taken frequently for <em>Britain</em>.</span><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><em>Ignotumq; Fretum</em>.<br /></span>
<p class="signature">Claud.</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>And if the Notions the World then had were true, it would be
very absurd for us who live here to pretend Miracles in any
Extremes of Tempests; since by what the Poets of those Ages
flourish'd about stormy Weather, was the native and most
proper Epithet of the Place:</p>
<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><em>Belluosus qui remotis</em><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>Obstrepit Oceanus</em> Britannis.<br /></span>
<p class="signature"><em>Hor.</em></p>
</div></div></div>

<p>Nay, some are for placing the Nativity of the Winds hereabouts,
as if they had been all generated here, and the Confluence
of Matter had made this Island its General Rendezvouz.</p>

<p>But I shall easily show, that there are several Places in the
World far better adapted to be the General Receptacle or Centre
of Vapours, to supply a Fund of Tempestuous Matter, than
<em>England</em>; as particularly the vast Lakes of <em>North America</em>: Of
which afterwards.</p>

<p>And yet I have two Notions, one real, one imaginary, of the
Reasons which gave the Ancients such terrible Apprehensions
of this Part of the World; which of late we find as Habitable and
Navigable as any of the rest.</p>

<p>The real Occasion I suppose thus: That before the Multitude
and Industry of Inhabitants prevail'd to the managing, enclosing,
and improving the Country, the vast Tract of Land in this
Island which continually lay open to the Flux of the Sea, and to
the Inundations of Land-Waters, were as so many standing
Lakes; from whence the Sun continually exhaling vast quantities
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>of moist Vapours, the Air could not but be continually crowded
with all those Parts of necessary Matter to which we ascribe the
Original of Winds, Rains, Storms, and the like.</p>

<p>He that is acquainted with the situation of <em>England</em>, and can
reflect on the vast Quantities of flat Grounds, on the Banks of
all our navigable Rivers, and the Shores of the Sea, which Lands
at Least lying under Water every Spring-Tide, and being thereby
continually full of moisture, were like a stagnated standing body
of Water brooding Vapours in the Interval of the Tide, must
own that at least a fifteenth part of the whole Island may come
into this Denomination.</p>

<p>Let him that doubts the Truth of this, examine a little the
Particulars; let him stand upon <em>Shooters-Hill</em> in <em>Kent</em>, and view
the Mouth of the River <em>Thames</em>, and consider what a River it
must be when none of the Marshes on either side were wall'd in
from the Sea, and when the Sea without all question flow'd up
to the Foot of the Hills on either Shore, and up every Creek,
where he must allow is now dry Land on either side the River
for two Miles in breadth at least, sometimes three or four, for
above forty Miles on both sides the River.</p>

<p>Let him farther reflect, how all these Parts lay when, as our
ancient Histories relate, the <em>Danish</em> Fleet came up almost to
<em>Hartford</em>, so that all that Range of fresh Marshes which reach
for twenty five Miles in length, from <em>Ware</em> to the River <em>Thames</em>,
must be a Sea.</p>

<p>In short, Let any such considering Person imagine the vast
Tract of Marsh-Lands on both sides the River <em>Thames</em>, to <em>Harwich</em>
on the <em>Essex</em> side, and to <em>Whitstable</em> on the <em>Kentish</em> side,
the Levels of Marshes up the <em>Stour</em> from <em>Sandwich</em> to <em>Canterbury</em>,
the whole Extent of Lowgrounds commonly call'd
<em>Rumney-Marsh</em>, from <em>Hythe</em> to <em>Winchelsea</em>, and up the Banks
of the <em>Rother</em>; all which put together, and being allow'd to be
in one place cover'd with Water, what a Lake wou'd it be
suppos'd to make? According to the nicest Calculations I can
make, it cou'd not amount to less than 500000 Acres of Land.</p>

<p>The Isle of <em>Ely</em>, with the <em>Flats</em> up the several Rivers from
<em>Yarmouth</em> to <em>Norwich</em>, <em>Beccles</em>, &amp;c. the continu'd Levels in the
several Counties of <em>Norfolk</em>, <em>Cambridge</em>, <em>Suffolk</em>, <em>Huntingdon</em>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span><em>Northampton</em>, and <em>Lincoln</em>, I believe do really contain as much
Land as the whole County of <em>Norfolk</em>; and 'tis not many Ages
since these Counties were universally one vast Moras or Lough,
and the few solid parts wholly unapproachable: insomuch that
the Town of <em>Ely</em> it self was a Receptacle for the Malecontents
of the Nation, where no reasonable Force cou'd come near to
dislodge them.</p>

<p>'Tis needless to reckon up twelve or fourteen like Places in
<em>England</em>, as the Moores in <em>Somersetshire</em>, the Flat-shores in
<em>Lancashire</em>, <em>Yorkshire</em>, and <em>Durham</em>, the like in <em>Hampshire</em> and
<em>Sussex</em>; and in short, on the Banks of every Navigable River.</p>

<p>The sum of the matter is this; That while this Nation was thus
full of standing Lakes, stagnated Waters, and moist Places, the
multitude of Exhalations must furnish the Air with a quantity
of Matter for Showers and Storms infinitely more than it can
be now supply'd withal, those vast Tracts of Land being now
fenc'd off, laid dry, and turn'd into wholsome and profitable
Provinces.</p>

<p>This seems demonstrated from <em>Ireland</em>, where the multitude
of Loughs, Lakes, Bogs, and moist Places, serve the Air with
Exhalations, which give themselves back again in Showers, and
make it be call'd, <em>The Piss-pot of the World</em>.</p>

<p>The imaginary Notion I have to advance on this Head,
amounts only to a Reflection upon the Skill of those Ages in the
Art of Navigation; which being far short of what it is since
arrived to, made these vast Northern Seas too terrible for them
to venture in: and accordingly, they rais'd those Apprehensions
up to Fable, which began only in their want of Judgment.</p>

<p>The <em>Phœnicians</em>, who were our first Navigators, the
<em>Genoese</em>, and after them the <em>Portuguese</em>, who arriv'd to extraordinary
Proficiency in Sea Affairs, were yet all of them, <em>as we
say</em>, Fair-weather Sea-men: The chief of their Navigation was
Coasting; and if they were driven out of their Knowledge, had
work enough to find their way home, and sometimes never
found it at all; but one Sea convey'd them directly into the last
Ocean, from whence no Navigation cou'd return them.</p>

<p>When these, by Adventures, or Misadventures rather, had at
any time extended their Voyaging as far as this Island, which,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>by the way, they always perform'd round the Coast of <em>Spain</em>,
<em>Portugal</em>, and <em>France</em>; if ever such a Vessel return'd, if ever the
bold Navigator arriv'd at home, he had done enough to talk
on all his Days, and needed no other Diversion among his
Neighbours, than to give an Account of the vast Seas, mighty
Rocks, deep Gulfs, and prodigious Storms he met with in these
remote Parts of the known World: and this, magnified by the
Poetical Arts of the Learned Men of those times, grew into a
receiv'd Maxim of Navigation, That these Parts were so full of
constant Tempests, Storms, and dangerous Seas, that 'twas
present Death to come near them, and none but Madmen and
Desperadoes could have any Business there, since they were
Places where Ships never came, and Navigation was not proper
in the Place.</p>
<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And <em>Thule</em>, where no Passage was<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For Ships their Sails to bear.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p><em>Horace</em> has reference to this horrid Part of the World, as a
Place full of terrible Monsters, and fit only for their Habitation,
in the Words before quoted.</p>
<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i5"><cite>Belluosus qui remotis</cite><br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><cite>Quanto Delphino Balæna Britannica major.</cite><br /></span>
<p class="signature">Juv.</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>Such horrid Apprehensions those Ages had of these Parts,
which by our Experience, and the Prodigy to which Navigation
in particular, and Sciential Knowledge in general, is since grown,
appear very ridiculous.</p>

<p>For we find no Danger in our Shores, no uncertain wavering
in our Tides, no frightful Gulfs, no horrid Monsters, but what
the bold Mariner has made familiar to him. The Gulfs which
frighted those early Sons of <em>Neptune</em> are search'd out by our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>Seamen, and made useful Bays, Roads, and Harbours of Safety.
The Promontories which running out into the Sea gave
them terrible Apprehensions of Danger, are our Safety, and
make the Sailors Hearts glad, as they are the first Lands they
make when they are coming Home from a long Voyage, or as
they are a good shelter when in a Storm our Ships get <em>under
their Lee</em>.</p>

<p>Our Shores are sounded, the Sands and Flats are discovered,
which they knew little or nothing of, and in which more real
Danger lies, than in all the frightful Stories they told us; useful
Sea-marks and Land-figures are plac'd on the Shore, Buoys on
the Water, Light-houses on the highest Rocks; and all these
dreadful Parts of the World are become the Seat of Trade, and
the Centre of Navigation: Art has reconcil'd all the Difficulties,
and Use made all the <em>Horribles</em> and <em>Terribles</em> of those Ages
become as natural and familiar as Day-light.</p>

<p>The Hidden Sands, almost the only real Dread of a Sailor,
and by which till the Channels between them were found out,
our Eastern Coast must be really unpassable, now serve to make
Harbours: and <em>Yarmouth</em> Road was made a safe Place for
Shipping by them. Nay, when <em>Portsmouth</em>, <em>Plymouth</em>, and
other good Harbours would not defend our Ships in the Violent
Tempest we are treating of, here was the least Damage done of
any Place in <em>England</em>, considering the Number of Ships which
lay at Anchor, and the Openness of the Place.</p>

<p>So that upon the whole it seems plain to me, that all the
dismal things the Ancients told us of <em>Britain</em>, and her terrible
Shores, arose from the Infancy of Marine Knowledge, and the
Weakness of the Sailor's Courage.</p>

<p>Not but that I readily allow we are more subject to bad
Weather and hard Gales of Wind than the Coasts of <em>Spain</em>,
<em>Italy</em>, and <em>Barbary</em>. But if this be allow'd, our Improvement in
the Art of Building Ships is so considerable, our Vessels are so
prepar'd to ride out the most violent Storms, that the Fury of
the Sea is the least thing our Sailors fear: Keep them but from <em>a
Lee Shore</em>, or touching upon a Sand, they'll venture all the
rest: and nothing is a greater satisfaction to them, if they have a
Storm in view, than a sound Bottom and good <em>Sea-room</em>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
From hence it comes to pass, that such Winds as in those
Days wou'd have pass'd for Storms, are called only a <em>Fresh-gale</em>,
or <em>Blowing hard</em>. If it blows enough to fright a South Country
Sailor, we laugh at it: and if our Sailors bald Terms were set
down in a Table of Degrees, it will explain what we mean.</p>

<table id="degree" summary="table of degrees">

<tr><td><em>Stark Calm.</em></td>
<td class="noborder"><em>A Top-sail Gale.</em></td></tr>
<tr><td><em>Calm Weather.</em></td>
<td class="noborder"><em>Blows fresh.</em></td></tr>
<tr><td><em>Little Wind.</em></td>
<td class="noborder"><em>A hard Gale of Wind.</em></td></tr>
<tr><td><em>A fine Breeze.</em></td>
<td class="noborder"><em>A Fret of Wind.</em></td></tr>
<tr><td><em>A small Gale.</em></td>
<td class="noborder"><em>A Storm.</em></td></tr>
<tr><td><em>A fresh Gale.</em></td>
<td class="noborder"><em>A Tempest.</em></td></tr>
</table>

<p>Just half these Tarpawlin Articles, I presume, would have
pass'd in those Days for a Storm; and that our Sailors call a
Top-sail Gale would have drove the Navigators of those Ages
into Harbours: when our Sailors reef a Top-sail, they would
have handed all their Sails; and when we go under a main
Course, they would have run <em>afore it</em> for Life to the next Port
they could make: when our <em>Hard Gale</em> blows, they would have
cried a Tempest; and about the <em>Fret of Wind</em> they would be all
at their Prayers.</p>

<p>And if we should reckon by this Account we are a stormy
Country indeed, our Seas are no more Navigable now for such
Sailors than they were then: If the <em>Japoneses</em>, the <em>East Indians</em>,
and such like Navigators, were to come with their thin Cockleshell
Barks and Calico Sails; if <em>Cleopatra's</em> Fleet, or <em>Cæsar's</em>
great Ships with which he fought the Battle of <em>Actium</em>, were
to come upon our Seas, there hardly comes a <em>March</em> or a <em>September</em>
in twenty Years but would blow them to Pieces, and
then the poor Remnant that got Home, would go and talk of a
terrible Country where there's nothing but Storms and Tempests;
when all the Matter is, the Weakness of their Shipping,
and the Ignorance of their Sea-men: and I make no question but
our Ships ride out many a worse Storm than that terrible Tempest
which scatter'd <em>Julius Cæsar's</em> Fleet, or the same that drove
<em>Æneas</em> on the Coast of <em>Carthage</em>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
And in more modern times we have a famous Instance in
the <em>Spanish Armada</em>; which, after it was rather frighted than
damag'd by Sir <em>Francis Drake</em>'s Machines, not then known by
the Name of Fireships, were scatter'd by a terrible Storm, and
lost upon every Shore.</p>

<p>The Case is plain, 'Twas all owing to the Accident of Navigation:
They had, no doubt, a hard Gale of Wind, and perhaps a
Storm; but they were also on an Enemy's Coast, their Pilots out
of their Knowledge, no Harbour to run into, and an Enemy
a-stern, that when once they separated, Fear drove them from
one Danger to another, and away they went to the Northward,
where they had nothing but God's Mercy, and the Winds and
Seas to help them. In all those Storms and Distresses which
ruin'd that Fleet, we do not find an Account of the Loss of one
Ship, either of the <em>English</em> or <em>Dutch</em>; the Queen's Fleet rode it
out in the <em>Downs</em>, which all Men know is none of the best
Roads in the World; and the <em>Dutch</em> rode among the Flats of the
<em>Flemish</em> Coast, while the vast Galleons, not so well fitted for the
Weather, were forc'd to keep the Sea, and were driven to and
fro till they had got out of their Knowledge; and like Men
desperate, embrac'd every Danger they came near.</p>

<p>This long Digression I could not but think needful, in order
to clear up the Case, having never met with any thing on this
Head before: At the same time 'tis allow'd, and Histories are
full of the Particulars, that we have often very high Winds,
and sometimes violent Tempests in these Northen Parts of the
World; but I am still of opinion, such a Tempest never happen'd
before as that which is the Subject of these Sheets: and I refer
the Reader to the Particulars.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<p class="subtitle"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
<em>Of the Storm in General</em></p>

<p class="noi">Before we come to examine the Damage suffer'd by this terrible
Night, and give a particular Relation of its dismal Effects; 'tis
necessary to give a summary Account of the thing it self, with
all its affrightning Circumstances.</p>

<p>It had blown exceeding hard, as I have already observ'd, for
about fourteen Days past; and that so hard, that we thought it
terrible Weather: Several Stacks of Chimnies were blown down,
and several Ships were lost, and the Tiles in many Places were
blown off from the Houses; and the nearer it came to the
fatal 26<em>th</em> of <em>November</em>, the Tempestuousness of the Weather
encreas'd.</p>

<p>On the <em>Wednesday</em> Morning before, being the 24<em>th</em> of <em>November</em>,
it was fair Weather, and blew hard; but not so as to give
any Apprehensions, till about 4 a Clock in the Afternoon the
Wind encreased, and with Squauls of Rain and terrible Gusts
blew very furiously.</p>

<p>The Collector of these Sheets narrowly escap'd the Mischief
of a Part of a House, which fell on the Evening of that Day by
the Violence of the Wind; and abundance of Tiles were blown
off the Houses that Night: the Wind continued with unusual
Violence all the next Day and Night; and had not the Great
Storm follow'd so soon, this had pass'd for a great Wind.</p>

<p>On <em>Friday</em> Morning it continued to blow exceeding hard, but
not so as that it gave any Apprehensions of Danger within
Doors; towards Night it encreased: and about 10 a Clock,
our Barometers inform'd us that the Night would be very
tempestuous; the <em>Mercury</em> sunk lower than ever I had observ'd
it on any Occasion whatsoever, which made me suppose the
Tube had been handled and disturb'd by the Children.</p>

<p>But as my Observations of this Nature are not regular enough
to supply the Reader with a full Information, the Disorders
of that dreadful Night having found me other Imployment,
expecting every Moment when the House I was in would bury
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>us all in its own Ruins; I have therefore subjoin'd a Letter from
an Ingenious Gentleman on this very Head, directed to the <em>Royal
Society</em>, and printed in the <cite>Philosophical Transactions</cite>, No. 289.
P. 1530. as follows.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="subtitle"><em>A Letter from the Reverend Mr.</em> William Derham, <em>F.R.S.
Containing his Observations concerning the late Storm</em>.</p>

<p class="salutation"><em>SIR</em>,</p>

<p class="noi">According to my Promise at the general Meeting of the <em>R.S.</em> on
St. <em>Andrews</em> Day, I here send you inclos'd the Account of my
Ingenious and Inquisitive Friend <em>Richard Townely</em>, Esq; concerning
the State of the Atmosphere in that Part of <em>Lancashire</em> where
he liveth, in the late dismal Storm. And I hope it will not be
unaccepable, to accompany his with my own Observations at
<em>Upminster</em>; especially since I shall not weary you with a long
History of the Devastations, <em>&amp;c.</em> but rather some Particulars of a
more Philosophical Consideration.</p>

<p>And first, I do not think it improper to look back to the
preceding Seasons of the Year. I scarce believe I shall go out of
the way, to reflect as far back as <em>April</em>, <em>May</em>, <em>June</em> and <em>July</em>;
because all these were wet Months in our Southern Parts. In <em>April</em>
there fell 12,49 <em>l.</em> of Rain through my Tunnel: And about 6, 7,
8, or 9, <em>l.</em> I esteem a moderate quantity for <em>Upminster. In</em> May
<em>there fell more than in any Month of any Year since the Year
1696</em>, viz. 20,77 <em>l. June</em> likewise was a dripping Month, in which
fell 14,55 <em>l.</em> And <em>July</em>, although it had considerable Intermissions,
yet had 14,19 <em>l.</em> above 11 <em>l.</em> of which fell on <em>July</em> 28<em>th</em> and 29<em>th</em>
in violent Showers. And I remember the News Papers gave
Accounts of great Rains that Month from divers Places of <em>Europe</em>;
but the <em>North of England</em> (which also escaped the Violence of the
late Storm) was not so remarkably wet in any of those Months;
at least not in that great proportion more than we, as usually they
are; as I guess from the Tables of Rain, with which Mr. <em>Towneley</em>
hath favoured me. Particularly <em>July</em> was a dry Month with them,
there being no more than 3,65 <em>l.</em> of Rain fell through Mr. <em>Towneley's</em>
Tunnel of the same Diameter with mine.</p>

<p>From these Months let us pass to <em>September</em>, and that we shall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>find to have been a wet Month, especially the latter part of it;
there fell of Rain in that Month, 14,86 <em>l.</em></p>

<p><em>October</em> and <em>November</em> last, although not remarkably wet, yet
have been open warm Months for the most part. My Thermometer
(whose freezing Point is about 84) hath been very seldom
below 100 all this Winter, and especially in <em>November</em>.</p>

<p>Thus I have laid before you as short Account as I could of the
preceding Disposition of the Year, particularly as to wet and
warmth, because I am of opinion that these had a great Influence
in the late Storm; not only in causing a Repletion of Vapours in
the Atmosphere, but also in raising such Nitro-sulphureous or
other heterogeneous matter, which when mix'd together might
make a sort of Explosion (like fired Gun-powder) in the Atmosphere.
And from this Explosion I judge those Corruscations or
Flashes in the Storm to have proceeded, which most People as
well as my self observed, and which some took for Lightning. But
these things I leave to better Judgments, such as that very ingenious
Member of our Society, who hath undertaken the Province
of the late Tempest; to whom, if you please, you may impart these
Papers; Mr. <em>Halley</em> you know I mean.</p>

<p>From Preliminaries it is time to proceed nearer to the Tempest
it self. And the foregoing Day, <em>viz. Thursday, Nov.</em> 25. I think
deserveth regard. In the Morning of that day was a little Rain,
the Winds high in the Afternoon: S.b.E. and S. In the Evening
there was Lightning; and between 9 and 10 of the Clock at Night,
a violent, but short Storm of Wind, and much Rain at <em>Upminster</em>;
and of Hail in some other Places, which did some Damage: There
fell in that Storm 1,65 <em>l.</em> of Rain. The next Morning, which was
<em>Friday, Novem.</em> 26. the Wind was S.S.W. and high all Day, and
so continued till I was in Bed and asleep. About 12 that Night,
the Storm awaken'd me, which gradually encreas'd till near 3 that
Morning; and from thence till near 7 it continued in the greatest
excess: and then began slowly to abate, and the <em>Mercury</em> to rise
swiftly. The Barometer I found at 12 h. ½ P.M. at 28,72, where it
continued till about 6 the next Morning, or 6¼, and then hastily
rose; so that it was gotten to 82 about 8 of the Clock, as in the
Table.</p>

<p>How the Wind sat during the late Storm I cannot positively
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>say, it being excessively dark all the while, and my Vane blown
down also, when I could have seen: But by Information from
Millers, and others that were forc'd to venture abroad; and by
my own guess, I imagin it to have blown about S.W. by S. or
nearer to the S. in the beginning, and to veer about towards the
West towards the End of the Storm, as far as W.S.W.</p>

<p>The degrees of the Wind's Strength being not measurable (that
I know of, though talk'd of) but by guess, I thus determine, with
respect to other Storms. On <em>Feb.</em> 7. 169<sup>8</sup>/<sub>9</sub>. was a terrible Storm
that did much damage. This I number 10 degrees; the Wind then
W.N.W. <em>vid. Ph. Tr. No.</em> 262. Another remarkable Storm was
<em>Feb.</em> 3. 170<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>. at which time was the greatest descent of the ☿
ever known: This I number 9 degrees. But this last of <em>November</em>,
I number at least 15 degrees.</p>

<p>As to the <em>Stations</em> of the <em>Barometer</em>, you have Mr. <em>Towneley</em>'s
and mine in the following Table to be seen at one View.</p>

As to <em>November</em> 17<em>th</em> (whereon Mr. <em>Towneley</em> mentions a
violent Storm in <em>Oxfordshire</em>) it was a Stormy Afternoon here at
<em>Upminster</em>, accompanied with Rain, but not violent, nor ☿ very
low. <em>November 11th</em> and <em>12th</em> had both higher Winds and more
Rain; and the ☿ was those Days lower than even in the last Storm
of <em>November</em> 26<em>th</em>.</p>

<p>Thus, Sir, I have given you the truest Account I can, of what I
thought most to deserve Observation, both before, and in the late
Storm. I could have added some other particulars, but that I fear
I have already made my Letter long, and am tedious. I shall
therefore only add, that I have Accounts of the Violence of the
Storm at <em>Norwich</em>, <em>Beccles</em>, <em>Sudbury</em>, <em>Colchester</em>, <em>Rochford</em>, and
several other intermediate places; but I need not tell Particulars,
because I question not but you have better Informations.</p>

<p class="center">
<em>Thus far Mr.</em> Derham<em>'s Letter</em>.</p></blockquote>

<p class="noi">It did not blow so hard till Twelve a Clock at Night, but that
most Families went to Bed; though many of them not without
some Concern at the terrible Wind, which then blew: But about
One, or at least by Two a Clock, 'tis suppos'd, few People, that
were capable of any Sense of Danger, were so hardy as to lie in
Bed. And the Fury of the Tempest encreased to such a Degree,
that as the Editor of this Account being in <em>London</em>, and conversing
with the People the next Days, understood, most People
expected the Fall of their Houses.</p>

<p>And yet in this general Apprehension, no body durst quit
their tottering Habitations; for whatever the Danger was within
doors, 'twas worse without; the Bricks, Tiles, and Stones, from
the Tops of the Houses, flew with such force, and so thick in
the Streets, that no one thought fit to venture out, tho' their
Houses were near demolish'd within.</p>

<p>The Author of this Relation was in a well-built brick House
in the skirts of the City; and a Stack of Chimneys falling in upon
the next Houses, gave the House such a Shock, that they thought
it was just coming down upon their Heads: but opening the
Door to attempt an Escape into a Garden, the Danger was so
apparent, that they all thought fit to surrender to the Disposal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>of Almighty Providence, and expect their Graves in the Ruins
of the House, rather than to meet most certain Destruction in
the open Garden: for unless they cou'd have gone above two
hundred Yards from any Building, there had been no Security,
for the Force of the Wind blew the Tiles point-blank, tho' their
weight inclines them downward: and in several very broad
Streets, we saw the Windows broken by the flying of Tile-sherds
from the other side: and where there was room for them to fly,
the Author of this has seen Tiles blown from a House above
thirty or forty Yards, and stuck from five to eight Inches into
the solid Earth. Pieces of Timber, Iron, and Sheets of Lead,
have from higher Buildings been blown much farther; as in the
Particulars hereafter will appear.</p>

<p>It is the receiv'd Opinion of abundance of People, that they
felt, during the impetuous fury of the Wind, several Movements
of the Earth; and we have several Letters which affirm it: But as
an Earthquake must have been so general, that every body must
have discern'd it; and as the People were in their Houses when
they imagin'd they felt it, the Shaking and Terror of which might
deceive their Imagination, and impose upon their Judgment; I
shall not venture to affirm it was so: And being resolv'd to use
so much Caution in this Relation as to transmit nothing to
Posterity without authentick Vouchers, and such Testimony as
no reasonable Man will dispute; so if any Relation come in our
way, which may afford us a Probability, tho' it may be related
for the sake of its Strangeness or Novelty, it shall nevertheless
come in the Company of all its Uncertainties, and the Reader
left to judge of its Truth: for this Account had not been undertaken,
but with design to undeceive the World in false Relations,
and to give an Account back'd with such Authorities, as that
the Credit of it shou'd admit of no Disputes.</p>

<p>For this reason I cannot venture to affirm that there was any
such thing as an Earthquake; but the Concern and Consternation
of all People was so great, that I cannot wonder at their
imagining several things which were not, any more than their
enlarging on things that were, since nothing is more frequent,
than for Fear to double every Object, and impose upon the
Understanding, strong Apprehensions being apt very often to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>perswade us of the Reality of such things which we have no
other reasons to shew for the probability of, than what are
grounded in those Fears which prevail at that juncture.</p>

<p>Others thought they heard it thunder. 'Tis confess'd, the Wind
by its unusual Violence made such a noise in the Air as had a
resemblance to Thunder; and 'twas observ'd, the roaring had a
Voice as much louder than usual, as the Fury of the Wind was
greater than was ever known: the Noise had also something in
it more formidable; it sounded aloft, and roar'd not very much
unlike remote Thunder.</p>

<p>And yet tho' I cannot remember to have heard it thunder, or
that I saw any Lightning, or heard of any that did in or near
<em>London</em>; yet in the Counties the Air was seen full of Meteors
and vaporous Fires: and in some places both Thundrings and
unusual Flashes of Lightning, to the great terror of the
Inhabitants.</p>

<p>And yet I cannot but observe here, how fearless such People
as are addicted to Wickedness, are both of God's Judgments
and uncommon Prodigies; which is visible in this Particular,
That a Gang of hardned Rogues assaulted a Family at <em>Poplar</em>,
in the very Height of the Storm, broke into the House, and
robb'd them: it is observable, that the People cryed Thieves,
and after that cryed Fire, in hopes to raise the Neighbourhood,
and to get some Assistance; but such is the Power of Self-Preservation,
and such was the Fear, the Minds of the People
were possess'd with, that no Body would venture out to the
Assistance of the distressed Family, who were rifled and plundered
in the middle of all the Extremity of the Tempest.</p>

<p>It would admit of a large Comment here, and perhaps not
very unprofitable, to examine from what sad Defect in Principle
it must be that Men can be so destitute of all manner of Regard
to invisible and superiour Power, to be acting one of the vilest
Parts of a Villain, while infinite Power was threatning the whole
World with Disolation, and Multitudes of People expected the
Last Day was at Hand.</p>

<p>Several Women in the City of <em>London</em> who were in Travail,
or who fell into Travail by the Fright of the Storm, were oblig'd
to run the risque of being delivered with such Help as they had;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>and Midwives found their own Lives in such Danger, that few
of them thought themselves oblig'd to shew any Concern for
the Lives of others.</p>

<p>Fire was the only Mischief that did not happen to make the
Night compleatly dreadful; and yet that was not so every where,
for in <em>Norfolk</em> the Town of &mdash;&mdash; was almost ruin'd by a furious
Fire, which burnt with such Vehemence, and was so fann'd by
the Tempest, that the Inhabitants had no Power to concern
themselves in the extinguishing it; the Wind blew the Flames,
together with the Ruines, so about, that there was no standing
near it; for if the People came to Windward they were in Danger
to be blown into the Flames; and if to Leeward the Flames
were so blown up in their Faces, they could not bear to come
near it.</p>

<p>If this Disaster had happen'd in <em>London</em>, it must have been
very fatal; for as no regular Application could have been made
for the extinguishing it, so the very People in Danger would
have had no Opportunity to have sav'd their Goods, and hardly
their Lives: for though a Man will run any Risque to avoid being
burnt, yet it must have been next to a Miracle, if any Person so
oblig'd to escape from the Flames had escap'd being knock'd on
the Head in the Streets; for the Bricks and Tiles flew about like
small Shot; and 'twas a miserable Sight, in the Morning after
the Storm, to see the Streets covered with Tyle-sherds, and
Heaps of Rubbish, from the Tops of the Houses, lying almost
at every Door.</p>

<p>From Two of the Clock the Storm continued, and encreased
till Five in the Morning; and from Five, to half an Hour after
Six, it blew with the greatest Violence: the Fury of it was so
exceeding great for that particular Hour and half, that if it had
not abated as it did, nothing could have stood its Violence much
longer.</p>

<p>In this last Part of the Time the greatest Part of the Damage
was done: Several Ships that rode it out till now, gave up all; for
no Anchor could hold. Even the Ships in the River of <em>Thames</em>
were all blown away from their Moorings, and from <em>Execution-Dock</em>
to <em>Lime-House Hole</em> there was but our Ships that rid it
out, the rest were driven down into the <em>Bite</em>, as the Sailors call
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>it, from <em>Bell-Wharf</em> to <em>Lime-House</em>; where they were huddeld
together and drove on Shore, Heads and Sterns, one upon
another, in such a manner, as any one would have thought it
had been impossible: and the Damage done on that Account
was incredible.</p>

<p>Together with the Violence of the Wind, the Darkness of the
Night added to the Terror of it; and as it was just New Moon,
the Spring Tides being then up at about Four a Clock, made the
Vessels, which were a-float in the River, drive the farther up
upon the Shore: of all which, in the Process of this Story, we
shall find very strange Instances.</p>

<p>The Points from whence the Wind blew, are variously
reported from various Hands: 'Tis certain, it blew all the Day
before at S.W. and I thought it continued so till about Two a
Clock; when, as near as I could judge by the Impressions it made
on the House, for we durst not look out, it veer'd to the S.S.W.
then to the W. and about Six a Clock to W. by N. and still the
more Northward it shifted, the harder it blew, till it shifted
again Southerly about Seven a Clock; and as it did so, it gradually
abated.</p>

<p>About Eight a Clock in the Morning it ceased so much, that
our Fears were also abated, and People began to peep out of
Doors; but 'tis impossible to express the Concern that appear'd
in every Place: the Distraction and Fury of the Night was visible
in the Faces of the People, and every Body's first Work was to
visit and enquire after Friends and Relations. The next Day or
Two was almost entirely spent in the Curiosity of the People, in
viewing the Havock the Storm had made, which was so universal
in <em>London</em>, and especially in the Out-Parts, that nothing can
be said sufficient to describe it.</p>

<p>Another unhappy Circumstance with which this Disaster was
join'd, was a prodigious Tide, which happen'd the next Day but
one, and was occasion'd by the Fury of the Winds: which is also
a Demonstration, that the Winds veer'd for Part of the Time to
the Northward: and as it is observable, and known by all that
understand our Sea Affairs, that a North West Wind makes the
Highest Tide, so this blowing to the Northward, and that with
such unusual Violence, brought up the Sea raging in such a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>manner, that in some Parts of <em>England</em> 'twas incredible, the
Water rising Six or Eight Foot higher than it was ever known to
do in the Memory of Man; by which Ships were fleeted up
upon the firm Land several Rods off from the Banks, and an
incredible Number of Cattle and People drown'd; as in the
Pursuit of this Story will appear.</p>

<p>It was a special Providence that so directed the Waters, that
in the River of <em>Thames</em>, the Tide, though it rise higher than
usual, yet it did not so prodigiously exceed; but the Height of
them as it was, prov'd very prejudicial to abundance of People
whose Cellars and Ware-houses were near the River; and had
the Water risen a Foot higher, all the Marshes and Levels on
both sides the River had been over-flowed, and a great part of
the Cattle drowned.</p>

<p>Though the Storm abated with the rising of the Sun, it still
blew exceeding hard; so hard, that no Boats durst stir out on
the River, but on extraordinary Occasions: and about Three a
Clock in the Afternoon, the next Day being <em>Saturday</em>, it increas'd
again, and we were in a fresh Consternation, lest it
should return with the same Violence. At Four it blew an
extreme Storm, with Sudden Gusts as violent as any time of the
Night; but as it came with a great black Cloud, and some
Thunder, it brought a hasty Shower of Rain which allay'd the
Storm: so that in a quarter of an Hour it went off, and only
continued blowing as before.</p>

<p>This sort of Weather held all <em>Sabbath-Day</em> and <em>Monday</em>, till
on <em>Tuesday</em> Afternoon it encreased again; and all <em>Tuesday</em> Night
it blew with such Fury, that many Families were afraid to go to
Bed: And had not the former terrible Night harden'd the People
to all things less than it self, this Night would have pass'd for a
Storm fit to have been noted in our Almanacks. Several Stacks
of Chimneys that stood out the great Storm, were blown down
in this; several Ships which escap'd in the great Storm, perish'd
this Night; and several People who had repair'd their Houses,
had them untiled again. Not but that I may allow those Chimneys
that fell now might have been disabled before.</p>

<p>At this Rate it held blowing till <em>Wednesday</em> about One a
Clock in the Afternoon, which was that Day Seven-night on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>which it began; so that it might be called one continued Storm
from <em>Wednesday</em> Noon to <em>Wednesday</em> Noon: in all which time,
there was not one Interval of Time in which a Sailor would not
have acknowledged it blew a Storm; and in that time two such
terrible Nights as I have describ'd.</p>

<p>And this I particularly noted as to Time, <em>Wednesday, Nov.</em>
the 24<em>th</em> was a calm fine Day as at that time of Year shall be
seen; till above Four a Clock, when it began to be Cloudy, and
the Wind rose of a sudden, and in half an Hours Time it blew a
Storm. <em>Wednesday, Dec.</em> the 2<em>d.</em> it was very tempestuous all the
Morning; at One a Clock the Wind abated, the Sky clear'd, and
by Four a Clock there was not a Breath of Wind.</p>

<p>Thus ended the Greatest and the Longest Storm that ever the
World saw. The Effects of this terrible Providence are the Subject
of the ensuing Chapter; and I close this with a Pastoral Poem
sent us among the Accounts of the Storm from a very ingenious
Author, and desir'd to be publish'd in this Account.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="subtitle"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>

<em>Of the Extent of this Storm, and from what Parts it
was suppos'd to come; with some Circumstances as
to the Time of it</em></p>

<p class="noi">As all our Histories are full of the Relations of Tempests and
Storms which have happened in various Parts of the World, I
hope it may not be improper that some of them have been thus
observ'd with their remarkable Effects.</p>

<p>But as I have all along insisted, that no Storm since the
Universal Deluge was like this, either in its Violence or its
Duration, so I must also confirm it as to the particular of its
prodigious Extent.</p>

<p>All the Storms and Tempests we have heard of in the World,
have been Gusts or Squauls of Wind that have been carried on
in their proper Channels, and have spent their Force in a shorter
space.</p>

<p>We feel nothing here of the Hurricanes of <em>Barbadoes</em>, the
North-Wests of <em>New England</em> and <em>Virginia</em>, the terrible Gusts
of the <em>Levant</em>, or the frequent Tempests of the <em>North Cape</em>.
When Sir <em>Francis Wheeler</em>'s Squadron perish'd at <em>Gibralter</em>,
when the City of <em>Straelsond</em> was almost ruin'd by a Storm,
<em>England</em> felt it not, nor was the Air here disturb'd with the
Motion. Even at home we have had Storms of violent Wind in
one part of <em>England</em> which have not been felt in another. And if
what I have been told has any truth in it, in St. <em>George</em>'s Channel
there has frequently blown a Storm at Sea right up and down
the Channel, which has been felt on neither Coast, tho it is not
above 20 Leagues from the <em>English</em> to the <em>Irish</em> Shore.</p>

<p>Sir <em>William Temple</em> gives us the Particulars of two terrible
Storms in <em>Holland</em> while he was there; in one of which the great
Cathedral Church at <em>Utrecht</em> was utterly destroy'd: and after
that there was a Storm so violent in <em>Holland</em>, that 46 Vessels
were cast away at the <em>Texel</em>, and almost all the Men drowned:
and yet we felt none of these Storms here.</p>

<p>And for this very reason I have reserv'd an Abridgment of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>these former Cases to this place; which as they are recited by Sir
<em>William Temple</em>, I shall put them down in his own Words, being
not capable to mend them, and not vain enough to pretend
to it.</p>

<p>'I stay'd only a Night at <em>Antwerp</em>, which pass'd with so great
Thunders and Lightnings, that I promis'd my self a very fair
Day after it, to go back to <em>Rotterdam</em> in the <em>States</em> Yacht, that
still attended me. The Morning prov'd so; but towards Evening
the Sky grew foul, and the Sea men presag'd ill Weather, and so
resolved to lie at Anchor before <em>Bergen ap Zoom</em>, the Wind
being cross and little. When the Night was fallen as black as
ever I saw, it soon began to clear up, with the most violent
Flashes of Lightning as well as Cracks of Thunder, that I believe
have ever been heard in our Age and Climate. This continued
all Night; and we felt such a fierce Heat from every great Flash
of Lightning, that the Captain apprehended it would fire his
Ship. But about 8 the next Morning the Wind changed, and
came up with so strong a Gale, that we came to <em>Rotterdam</em> in
about 4 Hours, and there found all Mouths full of the Mischiefs
and Accidents that the last Night's Tempest had occasioned
both among the Boats and the Houses, by the Thunder, Lightning,
Hail, or Whirlwinds. But the Day after came Stories to the
<em>Hague</em> from all Parts, of such violent Effects as were almost
incredible: At <em>Amsterdam</em> they were deplorable, many Trees
torn up by the Roots, Ships sunk in the Harbour, and Boats in
the Channels; Houses beaten down, and several People were
snatch'd from the Ground as they walk'd the Streets, and thrown
into the Canals. But all was silenc'd by the Relations from
<em>Utrecht</em>, where the Great and Ancient Cathedral was torn in
pieces by the Violences of this Storm; and the vast Pillars of
Stone that supported it, were wreathed like a twisted Club,
having been so strongly compos'd and cimented, as rather to
suffer such a Change of Figure than break in pieces, as other
Parts of the Fabrick did; hardly any Church in the Town escap'd
the Violence of this Storm; and very few Houses without the
Marks of it; Nor were the Effects of it less astonishing by
the Relations from <em>France</em> and <em>Brussels</em>, where the Damages
were infinite, as well from Whirlwinds, Thunder, Lightning, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>from Hail-stones of prodigious Bigness. This was in the Year
1674.</p>

<p>'In <em>November</em>, 1675, happen'd a Storm at <em>North-West</em>, with
a Spring-tide, so violent, as gave apprehensions of some loss
irrecoverable to the Province of <em>Holland</em>, and by several
breaches in the great Diques near <em>Enchusen</em>, and others between
<em>Amsterdam</em> and <em>Harlem</em>, made way for such Inundations as had
not been seen before by any man then alive, and fill'd the
Country with many relations of most deplorable Events. But the
incredible Diligence and unanimous Endeavours of the People
upon such occasions, gave a stop to the Fury of that Element,
and made way for recovering next Year all the Lands, though
not the People, Cattel, and Houses that had been lost.'</p>

<p class="center"><em>Thus far</em> Sir William Temple.</p>

<p class="noi">I am also credibly inform'd that the greatest Storm that ever we
had in <em>England</em> before, and which was as universal here as
this, did no Damage in <em>Holland</em> or <em>France</em>, comparable to this
Tempest: I mean the great Wind in 1661. An Abstract of which,
as it was printed in <em>Mirabilis Annis</em>, an unknown, but unquestion'd
Author, take as follows, in his own Words.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="subtitle"><em>A dreadful Storm of Wind, accompanied with Thunder,
Lightning, Hail and Rain; together with the sad Effects
of it in many Parts of the Nation.</em></p>

<p class="noi">Upon the 18<em>th</em> of <em>February</em>, 1661, being <em>Tuesday</em>, very early in
the Morning, there began a very great and dreadful Storm of
Wind (accompanied with Thunder, Lightning, Hail, and Rain,
which in many Places were as salt as Brine) which continued
with a strange and unusual Violence till almost Night: the sad
Effects whereof throughout the Nation are so many, that a very
great Volume is not sufficient to contain the Narrative of them.
And indeed some of them are so stupendious and amazing, that
the Report of them, though from never so authentick Hands, will
scarce gain Credit among any but those that have an affectionate
Sense of the unlimited Power of the Almighty, knowing and
believing that there is nothing too hard for Him to do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>

Some few of which wonderful Effects we shall give a brief
Account of, as we have received them from Persons of most
unquestionable Credit in the several Parts of the Nation.</p>

<p>In the City of <em>London</em>, and in <em>Covent Garden</em> and other Parts
about <em>London</em> and <em>Westminster</em>, five or six Persons were killed
outright by the Fall of Houses and Chimneys; especially one
Mr. <em>Luke Blith</em> an Attorney, that lived at or near <em>Stamford</em> in
the County of <em>Lincoln</em>, was killed that Day by the fall of a
Riding-House not far from <em>Pickadilla</em>: and there are some very
remarkable Circumstances in this Man's Case, which do make
his Death to appear at least like a most eminent Judgment and
severe Stroak of the Lord's Hand upon him.</p>

<p>From other Parts likewise we have received certain Information,
that divers Persons were killed by the Effects of this
great Wind.</p>

<p>At <em>Chiltenham</em> in <em>Gloucestershire</em>, a Maid was killed by the
Fall of a Tree, in or near the Church-Yard.</p>

<p>An honest Yeoman likewise of <em>Scaldwel</em> in <em>Northamptonshire</em>,
being upon a Ladder to save his Hovel, was blown off,
and fell upon a Plough, died outright, and never spoke Word
more.</p>

<p>Also at <em>Tewksbury</em> in <em>Gloucestershire</em>, a Man was blown
from an House, and broken to Pieces.</p>

<p>At <em>Elsbury</em> likewise in the same County, a Woman was killed
by the Fall of Tiles or Bricks from an House.</p>

<p>And not far from the same Place, a Girl was killed by the Fall
of a Tree.</p>

<p>Near <em>Northampton</em>, a Man was killed by the Fall of a great
Barn.</p>

<p>Near <em>Colchester</em>, a Young-man was killed by the Fall of a
Wind-mill.</p>

<p>Not far from <em>Ipswich</em> in <em>Suffolk</em>, a Man was killed by the Fall
of a Barn.</p>

<p>And about two Miles from the said Town of <em>Ipswich</em>, a Man
was killed by the Fall of a Tree.</p>

<p>At <em>Langton</em>, or near to it, in the County of <em>Leicester</em>, one Mr.
<em>Roberts</em> had a Wind-mill blown down, in which were three
Men; and by the Fall of it, one of them was killed outright, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>second had his Back broken, and the other had his Arm or Leg
struck off; and both of them (according to our best Information)
are since dead.</p>

<p>Several other Instances there are of the like Nature; but it
would be too tedious to mention them: Let these therefore
suffice to stir us up to Repentance, <em>lest we likewise perish</em>.</p>

<p>There are also many Effects of this Storm which are of another
Nature, whereof we shall give this following brief Account.</p>

<p>The Wind hath very much prejudiced many Churches in
several Parts of the Nation.</p>

<p>At <em>Tewksbury</em> in <em>Gloucestershire</em>, it blew down a very fair
Window belonging to the Church there, both the Glass, and the
Stone-work also; the Doors likewise of that Church were blown
open, much of the Lead torn up, and some Part of a fair Pinnacle
thrown down.</p>

<p>Also at <em>Red-Marly</em> and <em>Newin</em>, not far from <em>Tewksbury</em>,
their Churches are extreamly broken and shatter'd, if not a
considerable part of them blown down. The like was done to
most, if not all the Publick Meeting-places at <em>Gloucester</em> City.
And it is reported, that some Hundreds of Pounds will not
suffice to repair the Damage done to the Cathedral at <em>Worcester</em>,
especially in that Part that is over the Quire.</p>

<p>The like Fate happen'd to many more of them, as <em>Hereford</em>,
and <em>Leighton Beau-desart</em> in <em>Bedfordshire</em>, and <em>Eaton-Soken</em> in
the same County; where they had newly erected a very fair Cross
of Stone, which the Wind blew down: and, as some of the
Inhabitants did observe, that was the first Damage which that
Town sustained by the Storm, though afterwards in other
respects also they were in the same Condition with their Neighbours.
The Steeples also, and other Parts of the Churches of
<em>Shenley</em>, <em>Waddon</em>, and <em>Woolston</em> in the County of <em>Bucks</em>, have
been very much rent and torn by the Wind. The Spire of <em>Finchinfield</em>
Steeple in the County of <em>Essex</em>, was blown down, and it
brake through the Body of the Church, and spoil'd many of the
Pews; some Hundreds of Pounds will not repair that Loss. But
that which is most remarkable of this kind, is, the Fall of that
most famous Spire, or Pinnacle of the Tower-Church in <em>Ipswich</em>:
it was blown down upon the Body of the Church, and fell
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>reversed, the sharp End of the Shaft striking through the Leads
on the South-side of the Church, carried much of the Timber-work
down before it into the Alley just behind the Pulpit, and
took off one Side of the Sounding-board over the Pulpit: it
shattered many Pews: The Weather-Cock, and the Iron upon
which it stood, broke off as it fell; but the narrowest Part of the
Wood-work, upon which the Fane stood, fell into the Alley,
broke quite through a Grave-stone, and ran shoring under two
Coffins that had been placed there one on another; that Part of
the Spire which was pluck'd up was about three Yards deep in
the Earth, and it is believed some Part of it is yet behind in the
Ground: some Hundreds of Pounds will not make good the
Detriment done to the Church by the Fall of this Pinnacle.</p>

<p>Very great Prejudice has been done to private Houses; many
of them blown down, and others extreamly shattered and torn.
It is thought that five thousand Pounds will not make good the
Repairs at <em>Audley-End House</em>, which belongs to the Earl of
<em>Suffolk</em>. A good Part also of the Crown-Office in the <em>Temple</em> is
blown down. The Instances of this kind are so many and so
obvious, that it would needlesly take up too much time to give
the Reader an Account of the Collection of them; only there has
been such a wonderful Destruction of Barns, that (looking so
much like a Judgment from the Lord, who the last Year took
away our Corn, and this our Barns) we cannot but give a short
Account of some Part of that Intelligence which hath come to
our Hands of that Nature.</p>

<p>A Gentleman, of good Account, in <em>Ipswich</em>, affirms, that in a
few Miles riding that Day, there was eleven Barns and Out-houses
blown down in the Road within his View; and within a very few
Miles of <em>Ipswich</em> round about, above thirty Barns, and many of
them with Corn in them, were blown down. At <em>Southold</em> not far
from the Place before mentioned, many new Houses and Barns
(built since a late Fire that happened there) are blown down; as
also a Salt-house is destroyed there: and a thousand Pounds, as it
is believed, will not make up that particular Loss.</p>

<p>From <em>Tewksbury</em> it is certified, that an incredible Number of
Barns have been blown down in the small Towns and Villages
thereabouts. At <em>Twyning</em>, at least eleven Barns are blown down.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>In <em>Ashchurch</em> Parish seven or eight. At <em>Lee</em>, five. At <em>Norton</em>, a
very great Number, three whereof belonging to one Man. The
great Abby-Barn also at <em>Tewksbury</em> is blown down.</p>

<p>It is credibly reported, that within a very few Miles Circumference
in <em>Worcestershire</em>, about an hundred and forty Barns
are blown down. At <em>Finchinfield</em> in <em>Essex</em>, which is but an
ordinary Village, about sixteen Barns were blown down. Also
at a Town called <em>Wilchamsted</em> in the County of <em>Bedford</em> (a
very small Village) fifteen Barns at least are blown down. But
especially the Parsonage Barns went to wrack in many Places
throughout the Land: In a few Miles Compass in <em>Bedfordshire</em>,
and so in <em>Northamptonshire</em>, and other Places, eight, ten, and
twelve are blown down; and at <em>Yielding Parsonage</em> in the County
of <em>Bedford</em> (out of which was thrust by Oppression and Violence
the late Incumbent) all the Barns belonging to it are down. The
Instances also of this kind are innumerable, which we shall
therefore forbear to make further mention of.</p>

<p>We have also a large Account of the blowing down of a very
great and considerable Number of Fruit-Trees, and other Trees
in several Parts; we shall only pick out two or three Passages
which are the most remarkable. In the Counties of <em>Gloucester</em>,
<em>Hereford</em>, and <em>Worcester</em>, several Persons have lost whole
Orchards of Fruit-Trees; and many particular Mens Loss hath
amounted to the Value of forty or fifty Pounds at the least,
meerly by Destruction of their Fruit-Trees: and so in other Parts
of <em>England</em> proportionably the like Damage hath been sustained
in this Respect. And as for other Trees, there has been a great
Destruction made of them in many Places, by this Storm. Several
were blown down at <em>Hampton-Court</em>. And three thousand
brave Oaks at least, but in one principal Part of the Forest of
<em>Dean</em>, belonging to his Majesty. In a little Grove at <em>Ipswich</em>,
belonging to the Lord of <em>Hereford</em> (which together with the Spire
of the Steeple before-mentioned, were the most considerable
Ornaments of that Town) are blown down at least two hundred
goodly Trees, one of which was an Ash, which had ten Load of
Wood upon it: there are now few Trees left there.</p>

<p>In <em>Bramton Bryan Park</em> in the County of <em>Hereford</em>, belonging
to Sir <em>Edward Harly</em>, one of the late Knights of the <em>Bath</em>, above
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>thirteen hundred Trees are blown down; and above six hundred
in <em>Hopton Park</em> not far from it: and thus it is proportionably in
most Places where this Storm was felt. And the Truth is, the
Damage which the People of this Nation have sustained upon
all Accounts by this Storm, is not easily to be valued: some sober
and discreet People, who have endeavoured to compute the Loss
of the several Counties one with another, by the Destruction of
Houses and Barns, the blowing away of Hovels and Ricks of
Corn, the falling of Trees, <em>&amp;c.</em> do believe it can come to little
less than two Millions of Money.</p>

<p>There are yet behind many Particulars of a distinct Nature
from those that have been spoken of; some whereof are very
wonderful, and call for a very serious Observation of them.</p>

<p>In the Cities of <em>London</em> and <em>Westminster</em>, especially on the
Bridge and near <em>Wallingford-house</em>, several Persons were blown
down one on the Top of another.</p>

<p>In <em>Hertfordshire</em>, a Man was taken up, carried a Pole in
Length, and blown over a very high Hedge; and the like in
other Places.</p>

<p>The Water in the River of <em>Thames</em>, and other Places, was in
a very strange manner blown up into the Air: Yea, in the new
Pond in <em>James's Park</em>, the Fish, to the Number of at least two
Hundred, where blown out and lay by the Bank-side, whereof
many were Eye-witnesses.</p>

<p>At <em>Moreclack</em> in <em>Surry</em>, the <em>Birds</em>, as they attempted to fly,
were beaten down to the Ground by the Violence of the Wind.</p>

<p>At <em>Epping</em> in the County of <em>Essex</em>, a very great Oak was
blown down, which of it self was raised again, and doth grow
firmly at this Day.</p>

<p>At <em>Taunton</em>, a great Tree was blown down, the upper Part
whereof rested upon a Brick or Stone-wall, and after a little
time, by the force of the Wind, the lower part of the Tree was
blown quite over the Wall.</p>

<p>In the City of <em>Hereford</em>, several persons were, by the Violence
of the Wind, borne up from the Ground; one Man (as it is
credibly reported) at least six Yards.</p>

<p>The great Fane at <em>Whitehall</em> was blown down; and one of the
four which were upon the <em>white Tower</em>, and two more of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>them strangely bent; which are to be seen at this Day, to the
Admiration of all that behold them.</p>

<p>The several <em>Triumphant Arches</em> in the City of <em>London</em> were
much shattered and torn; That in <em>Leaden-hall-Street</em> lost the
King's Arms, and many other rare Pieces that were affixed to it;
That in <em>Cheapside</em>, which represented the Church, suffered very
much by the Fury of the Storm; and a great Part of that in <em>Fleet
Street</em> (which represented Plenty) was blown down: but, blessed
be God, none as we hear of were either killed or hurt by the Fall
of it.</p>

<p>The Wind was so strong, that it blew down several Carts
loaded with Hay in the Road between <em>Barnet</em> and <em>London</em>; and
in other Roads leading to the City of <em>London</em>.</p>

<p><em>Norwich</em> Coach, with four or six Horses, was not able to
come towards <em>London</em>, but stayed by the way till the Storm was
somewhat abated.</p>

<p>It is also credibly reported, That all, or some of the Heads
which were set up upon <em>Westminster-Hall</em>, were that Day
blown down.</p>

<p>There was a very dreadful Lightning which did at first accompany
the Storm, and by it some of his Majesty's Houshold
conceive that the Fire which happened at <em>Whitehall</em> that Morning,
was kindled; as also that at <em>Greenwich</em>, by which (as we are
informed) seven or eight Houses were burnt down.</p>

<p class="center"><em>Thus far the Author of</em> Mirabilis Annis.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="noi">'Tis very observable, that this Storm blew from the same Quarter
as the last, and that they had less of it Northward than here; in
which they were much alike.</p>

<p>Now as these Storms were perhaps very furious in some
Places, yet they neither came up to the Violence of this, nor any
way to be compar'd for the Extent, and when ruinous in one
County, were hardly heard of in the next.</p>

<p>But this terrible Night shook all <em>Europe</em>; and how much farther
it extended, he only knows who <em>has his way in the Whirlwind,
and in the Storm, and the Clouds are the Dust of his Feet</em>.</p>

<p>As this Storm was first felt from the West, some have conjectur'd
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>that the first Generation or rather Collection of Materials,
was from the Continent of <em>America</em>, possibly from that part of
<em>Florida</em> and <em>Virginia</em> where, if we respect natural Causes, the
Confluence of Vapours rais'd by the Sun from the vast and
unknown Lakes and Inland Seas of Water, which as some relate
are incredibly large as well as numerous, might afford sufficient
Matter for the Exhalation; and where time adding to the Preparation,
God, who has generally confin'd his Providence to the
Chain of natural Causes, might muster together those Troops
of Combustion till they made a sufficient Army duly proportion'd
to the Expedition design'd.</p>

<p>I am the rather inclin'd to this Opinion, because we are told,
they felt upon that Coast an unusual Tempest a few Days before
the fatal 27th of <em>November</em>.</p>

<p>I confess, I have never studied the Motion of the Clouds so
nicely, as to calculate how long time this Army of Terror might
take up in its furious March; possibly the Velocity of its Motion
might not be so great at its first setting out as it was afterward,
as a Horse that is to run a Race does not immediately put himself
into the height of his Speed: and tho' it may be true, that by the
length of the way the force of the Wind spends it self, and so by
degrees ceases as the Vapour finds more room for Dilation;
besides, yet we may suppose a Conjunction of some confederate
Matter which might fall in with it by the way, or which meeting
it at its Arrival here, might join Forces in executing the Commission
receiv'd from above, all natural Causes being allow'd a
Subserviency to the Direction of the great supream Cause; yet
where the vast Collection of Matter had its first Motion, as it
did not all take Motion in one and the same moment, so when
all the Parts had felt the Influence, as they advanc'd and press'd
those before them, the Violence must increase in proportion:
and thus we may conceive that the Motion might not have
arriv'd at its Meridian Violence till it reach'd our Island; and
even then it blew some Days with more than common fury, yet
much less than that last Night of its force; and even that Night
the Violence was not at its extremity till about an hour before
Sun-rise, and then it continued declining, tho' it blew a full
Storm for four Days after it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>

Thus Providence, by whose special Direction the Quantity
and Conduct of this Judgment was manag'd, seem'd to proportion
things so, as that by the course of things the proportion
of Matter being suited to Distance of Place, the Motion shou'd
arrive at its full Force just at the Place where its Execution was
to begin.</p>

<p>As then our Island was the first, this way, to receive the
Impressions of the violent Motion, it had the terriblest Effects
here; and continuing its steady Course, we find it carried a true
Line clear over the Continent of <em>Europe</em>, travers'd <em>England</em>,
<em>France</em>, <em>Germany</em>, the <em>Baltick</em> Sea, and passing the Northern
Continent of <em>Sweedland</em>, <em>Finland</em>, <em>Muscovy</em>, and part of <em>Tartary</em>,
must at last lose it self in the vast Northern Ocean, where Man
never came, and Ship never sail'd; and its Violence cou'd have
no effect, but upon the vast Mountains of Ice and the huge
Drifts of Snow, in which Abyss of Moisture and Cold it is very
probable the Force of it was check'd, and the World restor'd to
Calmness and Quiet: and in this Circle of Fury it might find its
End not far off from where it had its Beginning, the Fierceness
of the Motion perhaps not arriving to a Period, till having pass'd
the Pole, it reached again the Northern Parts of <em>America</em>.</p>

<p>The Effects of this impetuous Course, are the proper Subjects
of this Book; and what they might be before our Island felt its
Fury, who can tell? Those unhappy Wretches who had the
misfortune to meet it in its first Approach, can tell us little,
having been hurried by its irresistible Force directly into Eternity:
how many they are, we cannot pretend to give an Account;
we are told of about seventeen Ships, which having been out at
Sea are never heard of: which is the common way of Discourse
of Ships founder'd in the Ocean: and indeed all we can say of
them is, the fearful <em>Exit</em> they have made among the Mountains
of Waters, can only be duly reflected on by those who have seen
those Wonders of God in the Deep.</p>

<p>Yet I cannot omit here to observe, That this Loss was in all
probability much less than it would otherwise have been;
because the Winds having blown with very great Fury, at the
same Point, for near fourteen Days before the Violence grew to
its more uncommon height, all those Ships which were newly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>gone to Sea were forc'd back, of which some were driven into
<em>Plymouth</em> and <em>Falmouth</em> who had been above a hundred and
fifty Leagues at Sea; others, which had been farther, took
Sanctuary in <em>Ireland</em>.</p>

<p>On the other hand, All those Ships which were homeward
bound, and were within 500 Leagues of the <em>English</em> Shore, had
been hurried so furiously on <em>afore it</em> (<em>as the Seamen say</em>) that
they had reach'd their Port before the Extremity of the Storm
came on; so that the Sea was as it were swept clean of all
Shipping, those which were coming home were blown home
before their time; those that had attempted to put to Sea, were
driven back again in spight of all their Skill and Courage: for
the Wind had blown so very hard, directly into the Channel,
that there was no possibility of their keeping the Sea whose
Course was not right afore the Wind.</p>

<p>On the other hand, these two Circumstances had fill'd all our
Ports with unusual Fleets of Ships, either just come home or
outward-bound, and consequently the Loss among them was
very terrible; and the Havock it made among them, tho' it was
not so much as every body expected, was such as no Age or
Circumstance can ever parallel, and we hope will never feel
again.</p>

<p>Nay, so high the Winds blew even before <em>that we call the
Storm</em>, that had not that intolerable Tempest follow'd so soon
after, we should have counted those Winds extraordinary high:
and any one may judge of the Truth of this from these few
Particulars; That the <em>Russia</em> Fleet, compos'd of near a hundred
Sail, which happen'd to be then upon the Coast, was absolutely
dispers'd and scatter'd, some got into <em>Newcastle</em>, some into
<em>Hull</em>, and some into <em>Yarmouth</em> Roads; two founder'd in the Sea;
one or two more run a-shore, and were lost; and the <em>Reserve</em>
Frigat, their Convoy, founder'd in <em>Yarmouth</em> Roads, all her
Men being lost, and no Boat from the Shore durst go off to
relieve her, tho' it was in the Day-time, but all her Men perished.</p>

<p>In the same previous Storms the&mdash;Man of War was lost off
of <em>Harwich</em>; but by the help of smaller Vessels most of her Men
were sav'd.</p>

<p>And so high the Winds blew for near a Fortnight, that no Ship
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>stirr'd out of Harbour; and all the Vessels, great or small, that
were out at Sea, made for some Port or other for shelter.</p>

<p>In this juncture of time it happen'd, that together with the
<em>Russia</em> Fleet, a great Fleet of Laden Colliers, near 400 Sail, were
just put out of the River <em>Tine</em>: and these being generally deep
and unweildy Ships, met with hard measure, tho' not so fatal to
them as was expected: such of them as could run in for <em>Humber</em>,
where a great many were lost afterwards, as I shall relate in its
course; some got shelter under the high Lands of <em>Cromer</em> and
the Northern Shores of the County of <em>Norfolk</em>, and the greater
number reach'd into <em>Yarmouth</em> Roads.</p>

<p>So that when the Great Storm came, our Ports round the
Sea-Coast of <em>England</em> were exceeding full of Ships of all sorts:
a brief account whereof take as follows.</p>

<p>At <em>Grimsby</em>, <em>Hull</em>, and the other Roads of the <em>Humber</em>, lay
about 80 Sail, great and small, of which about 50 were Colliers,
and part of the <em>Russia</em> Fleet as aforesaid.</p>

<p>In <em>Yarmouth</em> Roads there rode at least 400 Sail, being most
of them Laden Colliers, <em>Russia</em> Men, and Coasters from <em>Lynn</em>
and <em>Hull</em>.</p>

<p>In the River of <em>Thames</em>, at the <em>Nore</em>, lay about 12 Sail of the
Queen's hir'd Ships and Store-ships, and only two Men of War.</p>

<p>Sir <em>Cloudsly Shovel</em> was just arriv'd from the <em>Mediterranean</em>
with the Royal Navy: Part of them lay at <em>St. Hellens</em>, part in the
<em>Downs</em>, and with 12 of the biggest Ships he was coming round
the <em>Foreland</em> to bring them into <em>Chatham</em>; and when the Great
Storm began was at an Anchor at the <em>Gunfleet</em>, from whence
the <em>Association</em> was driven off from Sea as far as the Coast of
<em>Norway</em>: What became of the rest, I refer to a Chapter by it self.</p>

<p>At <em>Gravesend</em> there rode five <em>East India</em> Men, and about 30
Sail of other Merchant-men, all outward bound.</p>

<p>In the <em>Downs</em> 160 Sail of Merchant Ships outward bound,
besides that part of the Fleet which came in with Sir <em>Cloudsly
Shovel</em>, which consisted of about 18 Men of War, with Tenders
and Victuallers.</p>

<p>At <em>Portsmouth</em> and <em>Cowes</em> there lay three Fleets; first, a Fleet
of Transports and Tenders, who with Admiral <em>Dilks</em> brought
the Forces from <em>Ireland</em> that were to accompany the King of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span><em>Spain</em> to <em>Lisbon</em>; secondly, a great Fleet of Victuallers, Tenders,
Store-ships, and Transports, which lay ready for the same Voyage,
together with about 40 Merchant-ships, who lay for the
benefit of their Convoy; and the third Article was, the Remainder
of the Grand Fleet which came in with Sir <em>Cloudsly Shovel</em>; in
all almost 300 Sail, great and small.</p>

<p>In <em>Plymouth</em> Sound, <em>Falmouth</em> and <em>Milford</em> Havens, were
particularly several small Fleets of Merchant-ships, driven in for
Shelter and Harbour from the Storm, most homeward bound
from the Islands and Colonies of <em>America</em>.</p>

<p>The <em>Virginia</em> Fleet, <em>Barbadoes</em> Fleet, and some <em>East India</em>
Men, lay scatter'd in all our Ports, and in <em>Kinsale</em> in <em>Ireland</em>
there lay near 80 Sail, homeward bound and richly laden.</p>

<p>At <em>Bristol</em> about 20 Sail of home-bound <em>West India</em> Men, not
yet unladen.</p>

<p>In <em>Holland</em>, the Fleet of Transports for <em>Lisbon</em> waited for the
King of <em>Spain</em>, and several <em>English</em> Men of War lay at <em>Helvoet
Sluice</em>; the <em>Dutch</em> Fleet from the <em>Texel</em> lay off of <em>Cadsandt</em>, with
their Forces on Board, under the Admiral <em>Callenberge</em>. Both
these Fleets made 180 Sail.</p>

<p>I think I may very safely affirm, That hardly in the Memory
of the oldest Man living, was a juncture of Time when an
Accident of this nature could have happen'd, that so much
Shipping, laden out and home, ever was in Port at one time.</p>

<p>No Man will wonder that the Damages to this Nation were
so great, if they consider these unhappy Circumstances: it shou'd
rather be wonder'd at, that we have no more Disasters to
account to Posterity, but that the Navigation of this Country
came off so well.</p>

<p>And therefore some People have excus'd the Extravagancies
of the <em>Paris Gazetteer</em>, who affirm'd in Print, that there was
30000 Sea-men lost in the several Ports of <em>England</em>, and 300
Sail of Ships; which they say was a probable Conjecture; and
that considering the multitude of Shipping, the Openness of
the Roads in the <em>Downs</em>, <em>Yarmouth</em>, and the <em>Nore</em>, and the
prodigious Fury of the Wind, any Man would have guess'd the
same as he.</p>

<p>'Tis certain, It is a thing wonderful to consider, that especially
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>in the <em>Downs</em> and <em>Yarmouth</em> Roads any thing shou'd be safe:
all Men that know how wild a Road the first is, and what
Crowds of Ships there lay in the last; how almost every thing
quitted the Road, and neither Anchor nor Cable would hold;
must wonder what Shift or what Course the Mariners could
direct themselves to for Safety.</p>

<p>Some which had not a Mast standing, nor an Anchor or Cable
left them, went out to Sea wherever the Winds drove them; and
lying like a Trough in the Water, wallow'd about till the Winds
abated; and after were driven, some into one Port, some into
another, as Providence guided them.</p>

<p>In short, Horror and Confusion seiz'd upon all, whether on
Shore or at Sea: No Pen can describe it, no Tongue can express
it, no Thought conceive it, unless some of those who were in the
Extremity of it; and who, being touch'd with a due sense of the
sparing Mercy of their Maker, retain the deep Impressions of
his Goodness upon their Minds, tho' the Danger be past: and
of those I doubt the Number is but few.</p>
<hr class="chap" />
<h2>OF THE EFFECTS OF THE STORM</h2>

<p class="noi">The particular dreadful Effects of this Tempest, are the Subject
of the ensuing Part of this History: And tho' the Reader is not
to expect that all the Particulars can be put into this Account,
and perhaps many very remarkable Passages may never come
to our Knowledge; yet as we have endeavour'd to furnish our
selves with the most authentick Accounts we could from all
Parts of the Nation, and a great many worthy Gentlemen have
contributed their Assistance in various, and some very exact
Relations and curious Remarks; so we pretend, not to be meanly
furnish'd for this Work.</p>

<p>Some Gentlemen, whose Accounts are but of common and
trivial Damages, we hope will not take it ill from the Author, if
they are not inserted at large; for that we are willing to put in
nothing here common with other Accidents of like nature; or
which may not be worthy of a History and a Historian to
record them; nothing but, what may serve to assist in convincing
Posterity that this was the most violent Tempest the World ever
saw.</p>

<p>From hence 'twill follow, that those Towns who only had
their Houses until'd, their Barns and Hovels levell'd with the
Ground, and the like, will find very little notice taken of them
in this Account; because if these were to be the Subject of a
History, I presume it must be equally voluminous with <em>Fox</em>,
<em>Grimston</em>, <em>Holinshead</em> or <em>Stow</em>.</p>

<p>Nor shall I often trouble the Reader with the Multitude or
Magnitude of Trees blown down, whole Parks ruin'd, fine Walks
defac'd, and Orchards laid flat, and the like: and tho' I had, my
self, the Curiosity to count the Number of Trees, in a Circuit I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>rode, over most part of <em>Kent</em>, in which being tired with the
Number, I left off reckoning after I had gone on to 17000; and
tho' I have great reason to believe I did not observe one half of
the Quantity; yet in some Parts of <em>England</em>, as in <em>Devonshire</em>
especially, and the Counties of <em>Worcester</em>, <em>Gloucester</em>, and
<em>Hereford</em>, which are full of very large Orchards of Fruit-Trees,
they had much more mischief.</p>

<p>In the Pursuit of this Work, I shall divide it into the following
Chapters or Sections, that I may put it into as good Order as
possible.</p>

</table>

<p>We had design'd a Chapter for the Damages abroad, and
have been at no small Charge to procure the Particulars from
foreign Parts; which are now doing in a very authentick manner:
but as the World has been long expecting this Work, and several
Gentlemen who were not a little contributing to the Information
of the Author, being unwilling to stay any longer for the
Account, it was resolved to put it into the Press without any
farther Delay: and if the foreign Accounts can be obtain'd in
time, they shall be a Supplement to the Work; if not, some other
Method shall be found out to make them publick.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span><em>I. Of the Damages in the City of London, and
Parts adjacent</em></h2>

<p class="noi">Indeed the City was a strange Spectacle, the Morning after the
Storm, as soon as the People could put their Heads out of Doors:
though I believe, every Body expected the Destruction was bad
enough; yet I question very much, if any Body believed the
Hundredth Part of what they saw.</p>

<p>The Streets lay so covered with Tiles and Slates, from the Tops
of the Houses, especially in the Out-parts, that the Quantity is
incredible: and the Houses were so universally stript, that all
the Tiles in Fifty Miles round would be able to repair but a small
Part of it.</p>

<p>Something may be guest at on this Head, from the sudden
Rise of the Price of Tiles; which rise from 21 <em>s. per</em> Thousand to
6 <em>l.</em> for plain Tiles; and from 50 <em>s. per</em> Thousand for Pantiles, to
10 <em>l.</em> and Bricklayers Labour to 5 <em>s. per</em> Day: And tho' after the
first Hurry the Prices fell again, it was not that the Quantity was
supply'd; but because,</p>

<p>1<em>st</em>, The Charge was so extravagant, that an universal Neglect
of themselves, appear'd both in Landlord and Tenant; an incredible
Number of Houses remain'd all the Winter uncovered, and
expos'd to all the Inconveniences of Wet and Cold; and are so
even at the Writing of this Chapter.</p>

<p>2. Those People who found it absolutely necessary to cover
their Houses, but were unwilling to go to the extravagant Price
of Tiles; chang'd their Covering to that of Wood, as a present
Expedient, till the Season for making of Tiles should come on;
and the first Hurry being over, the Prices abate: and 'tis on this
Score, that we see, to this Day, whole Ranks of Buildings, as in
<em>Christ Church Hospital</em>, the <em>Temple</em>, <em>Asks-Hospital</em>, <em>Old-street</em>,
<em>Hogsden-Squares</em>, and infinite other Places, covered entirely
with Deal Boards; and are like to continue so, perhaps a Year
or two longer, for Want of Tiles.</p>

<p>These two Reasons reduc'd the Tile-Merchants to sell at a
more moderate Price: But 'tis not an irrational Suggestion, that
all the Tiles which shall be made this whole Summer, will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>not repair the Damage in the covering of Houses within the
Circumference of the City, and Ten Miles round.</p>

<p>The next Article in our Street Damage was, the Fall of Chimneys;
and as the Chimneys in the City Buildings are built in large
Stacks, the Houses being so high, the Fall of them had the more
Power, by their own Weight, to demolish the Houses they fell
upon.</p>

<p>'Tis not possible to give a distinct Account of the Number, or
particular Stacks of Chimneys, which fell in this fatal Night; but
the Reader may guess by this Particular, that in <em>Cambray-House</em>,
commonly so called, a great House near <em>Islington</em>, belonging to
the Family of the <em>Comptons</em>, Earls of <em>Northampton</em>, but now
let out into Tenements; the Collector of these Remarks counted
Eleven or Thirteen Stacks of Chimneys, either wholly thrown
in, or the greatest Parts of them at least, what was expos'd to
the Wind, blown off. I have heard Persons, who pretended to
observe the Desolation of that terrible Night very nicely; and
who, by what they had seen and enquired into, thought themselves
capable of making some Calculations, affirm, They could
give an Account of above Two Thousand Stacks of Chimneys
blown down in and about <em>London</em>; besides Gable Ends of
Houses, some whole Roofs, and Sixteen or Twenty whole
Houses in the Out-Parts.</p>

<p>Under the Disaster of this Article, it seems most proper to
place the Loss of the Peoples Lives, who fell in this Calamity;
since most of those, who had the Misfortune to be killed, were
buried, or beaten to Pieces with the Rubbish of the several Stacks
of Chimneys that fell.</p>

<p>Of these, our Weekly Bills of Mortality gave us an Account
of Twenty One; besides such as were drown'd in the River, and
never found: and besides above Two Hundred People very much
wounded and maim'd.</p>

<p>One Woman was kill'd by the Fall of a Chimney in or near
the Palace of St. <em>James</em>'s, and a Stack of Chimneys falling in the
new unfinish'd Building there, and carried away a Piece of the
Coin of the House.</p>

<p>Nine Souldiers were hurt, with the Fall of the Roof of the
Guard-house at <em>Whitehall</em>, but none of them died.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>

A Distiller in <em>Duke-Street</em>, with his Wife, and Maid-servant,
were all buried in the Rubbish of a Stack of Chimneys, which
forced all the Floors, and broke down to the Bottom of the
House; the Wife was taken out alive, though very much bruised,
but her Husband and the Maid lost their Lives.</p>

<p>One Mr. <em>Dyer</em>, a Plaisterer in <em>Fetter-Lane</em>, finding the
Danger he was in by the shaking of the House, jumpt out of
Bed to save himself; and had, in all Probability, Time enough
to have got out of the House, but staying to strike a Light, a
Stack of Chimneys fell in upon him, kill'd him, and wounded
his Wife.</p>

<p>Two Boys at one Mr. <em>Purefoy's</em>, in <em>Cross-Street Hatton-Garden</em>,
were both kill'd, and buried in the Rubbish of a Stack
of Chimneys; and a third very much wounded.</p>

<p>A Woman in <em>Jewin-Street</em>, and Two Persons more near
<em>Aldersgate-Street</em>, were kill'd; the first, as it is reported, by
venturing to run out of the House into the Street; and the other
Two by the Fall of a House.</p>

<p>In <em>Threadneedle-Street</em>, one Mr. <em>Simpson</em>, a Scrivener being
in Bed and fast a-sleep, heard nothing of the Storm; but the rest
of the Family being more sensible of Danger, some of them went
up, and wak'd him; and telling him their own Apprehensions,
press'd him to rise; but he too fatally sleepy, and consequently
unconcern'd at the Danger, told them, he did not apprehend
any Thing; and so, notwithstanding all their Persuasions, could
not be prevailed with to rise: they had not been gone many
Minutes out of his Chamber, before the Chimneys fell in, broke
through the Roof over him, and kill'd him in his Bed.</p>

<p>A Carpenter in <em>White-Cross-Street</em> was kill'd almost in the
same Manner, by a Stack of Chimneys of the <em>Swan</em> Tavern,
which fell into his House; it was reported, That his Wife earnestly
desir'd him not to go to Bed; and had prevail'd upon him
to sit up till near two a Clock, but then finding himself very
heavy, he would go to Bed against all his Wife's Intreaties; after
which she wak'd him, and desir'd him to rise, which he refus'd,
being something angry for being disturb'd; and going to sleep
again, was kill'd in his Bed: and his Wife, who would not go to
Bed, escap'd.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>

In this Manner, our Weekly Bills gave us an Account of
Twenty One Persons kill'd in the City of <em>London</em>, and Parts
adjacent.</p>

<p>Some of our printed Accounts give us larger and plainer
Accounts of the Loss of Lives, than I will venture to affirm for
Truth; as of several Houses near <em>Moor-Fields</em> levell'd with the
Ground: Fourteen People drowned in a Wherry going to
<em>Gravesend</em>, and Five in a Wherry from <em>Chelsey</em>. Not that it is
not very probable to be true; but as I resolve not to hand any
thing to Posterity, but what comes very well attested, I omit
such Relations as I have not extraordinary Assurance as to the
Fact.</p>

<p>The Fall of Brick-Walls, by the Fury of this Tempest, in and
about <em>London</em>, would make a little Book of it self; and as this
affects the Out-Parts chiefly, where the Gardens and Yards are
wall'd in, so few such have escap'd; at St. <em>James</em>'s a considerable
part of the Garden Wall; at <em>Greenwich Park</em> there are several
pieces of the Wall down for an Hundred Rods in a Place; and
some much more, at <em>Battersey</em>, <em>Chelsey</em>, <em>Putney</em>, at <em>Clapham</em>, at
<em>Deptford</em>, at <em>Hackney</em>, <em>Islington</em>, <em>Hogsden</em>, <em>Wood's Close</em> by
St. <em>John's Street</em>, and on every side the City, the Walls of the
Gardens have generally felt the Shock, and lie flat on the Ground
twenty, thirty Rod of walling in a Place.</p>

<p>The publick Edifices of the City come next under our Consideration;
and these have had their Share in the Fury of this
terrible Night.</p>

<p>A part of her Majesty's Palace, as is before observ'd, with a
Stack of Chimneys in the Centre of the new Buildings, then not
quite finished, fell with such a terrible Noise as very much
alarm'd the whole Houshold.</p>

<p>The Roof of the Guard-house at <em>Whitehall</em>, as is also observ'd
before, was quite blown off; and the great Vane, or Weather-Cock
at <em>Whitehall</em> blown down.</p>

<p>The Lead, on the Tops of the Churches and other Buildings,
was in many Places roll'd up like a Roll of Parchment, and
blown in some Places clear off from the Buildings; as at <em>Westminster
Abby</em>, St. <em>Andrews Holbourn</em>, <em>Christ-Church Hospital</em>,
and abundance of other Places.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>

Two of the new built Turrets, on the Top of St. <em>Mary Aldermary
Church</em>, were blown off, whereof One fell upon the Roof
of the Church; of Eight Pinnacles on the Top of St. <em>Albans
Woodstreet</em>, Five of them were blown down; Part of One of the
Spires of St. <em>Mary Overies</em> blown off; Four Pinnacles on the
Steeple of St. <em>Michael Crooked Lane</em> blown quite off: The Vanes
and Spindles of the Weather-Cocks, in many places, bent quite
down; as on St. <em>Michael Cornhil</em>, St. <em>Sepulchres</em>, the <em>Tower</em>, and
divers other Places.</p>

<p>It was very remarkable, that the Bridge over the <em>Thames</em>
received but little Damage, and not in Proportion to what in
common Reason might be expected; since the Buildings there
stand high, and are not sheltered, as they are in the Streets, one
by another.</p>

<p>If I may be allow'd to give this Philosophical Account of it, I
hope it may not be absurd; that the Indraft of the Arches
underneath the Houses giving Vent to the Air, it past there with
a more than common Current; and consequently relieved the
Buildings, by diverting the Force of the Storm: I ask Pardon of
the ingenious Reader for this Opinion, if it be not regular, and
only present it to the World for Want of a better; if those better
furnished <em>that Way</em> will supply us with a truer Account, I shall
withdraw mine, and submit to theirs. The Fact however is
certain, that the Houses on the <em>Bridge</em> did not suffer in Proportion
to the other Places; though all must allow, they do not
seem to be stronger built, than other Streets of the same sort.</p>

<p>Another Observation I cannot but make; to which, as I have
Hundreds of Instances, so I have many more Witnesses to the
Truth of Fact, and the uncommon Experiment has made it the
more observ'd.</p>

<p>The Wind blew, during the whole Storm, between the Points
of S.W. and N.W., not that I mean it blew at all these Points,
but I take a Latitude of Eight Points to avoid Exceptions, and
to confirm my Argument; since what I am insisting upon, could
not be a natural Cause from the Winds blowing in any of those
particular Points.</p>

<p>If a Building stood North and South, it must be a Consequence
that the East-side Slope of the Roof must be the Lee-side, lie out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>of the Wind, be weather'd by the Ridge, and consequently
receive no Damage in a direct Line.</p>

<p>But against this rational way of arguing, we are convinced by
Demonstration and Experiment, after which Argument must be
silent. It was not in one Place or Two, but in many Places; that
where a Building stood ranging North and South, the Sides or
Slopes of the Roof to the East and the West, the East-side of the
Roof would be stript and untiled by the Violence of the Wind;
and the West Side, which lay open to the Wind, be sound and
untouch'd.</p>

<p>This, I conceive, must happen either where the Building had
some open Part, as Windows or Doors to receive the Wind in the
Inside, which being pusht forward by the succeeding Particles of
the Air, must force its Way forward, and so lift off the Tiling on
the Leeward side of the Building; or it must happen from the
Position of such Building near some other higher Place or Building,
where the Wind being repuls'd, must be forc'd back again
in Eddies; and consequently taking the Tiles from the lower Side
of the Roof, rip them up with the more Ease.</p>

<p>However it was, it appear'd in many Places, the Windward
Side of the Roof would be whole, and the Leeward Side, or the
Side from the Wind, be untiled; in other Places, a high Building
next the Wind has been not much hurt, and a lower Building on
the Leeward Side of the high One clean ript, and hardly a Tile
left upon it: this is plain in the Building of <em>Christ Church
Hospital</em> in <em>London</em>, where the Building on the West and South
Side of the Cloyster was at least Twenty Five Foot higher
than the East Side, and yet the Roof of the lower Side on the
East was quite untiled by the Storm; and remains at the Writing
of This covered with Deal Boards above an Hundred Foot in
Length.</p>

<p>The blowing down of Trees may come in for another Article
in this Part; of which, in Proportion to the Quantity, here was
as much as in any Part of <em>England</em>: Some printed Accounts tell
us of Seventy Trees in <em>Moorfields</em> blown down, which may be
true; but that some of them were Three Yards about, as is
affirmed by the Authors, I cannot allow: above a Hundred Elms
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>in St. <em>James's Park</em>, some whereof were of such Growth, as they
tell us they were planted by Cardinal <em>Woolsey</em>; whether that
Part of it be true or not, is little to the Matter, but only to imply
that they were very great Trees: about <em>Baums</em>, commonly call'd
<em>Whitmore house</em>, there were above Two Hundred Trees blown
down, and some of them of extraordinary Size broken off in the
middle.</p>

<p>And 'twas observ'd, that in the Morning after the Storm was
abated, it blew so hard, the Women, who usually go for Milk
to the Cow-keepers in the Villages round the City, were not able
to go along with their Pails on their Heads; and One, that was
more hardy than the rest, was blown away by the Fury of the
Storm, and forced into a Pond, but by strugling hard got out,
and avoided being drowned; and some that ventured out with
Milk the Evening after, had their Pails and Milk blown off from
their Heads.</p>

<p>'Tis impossible to enumerate the Particulars of the Damage
suffered, and of the Accidents which happened under these
several Heads, in and about the City of <em>London</em>: The Houses
looked like Skeletons, and an universal Air of Horror seem'd to
sit on the Countenances of the People; all Business seem'd to be
laid aside for the Time, and People were generally intent upon
getting Help to repair their Habitations.</p>

<p>It pleased God so to direct things, that there fell no Rain in
any considerable Quantity, except what fell the same Night or
the ensuing Day, for near Three Weeks after the Storm, though
it was a Time of the Year that is generally dripping. Had a wet
Rainy Season followed the Storm, the Damage which would
have been suffered in and about this City to Houshold Goods,
Furniture and Merchandise, would have been incredible, and
might have equall'd all the the rest of the Calamity: but the
Weather prov'd fair and temperate for near a Month after the
Storm, which gave People a great deal of Leisure in providing
themselves Shelter, and fortifying their Houses against the Accidents
of Weather by Deal Boards, old Tiles, Pieces of Sail-Cloth,
Tarpaulin, and the like.</p>

<em>II. Of the Damages in the Country</em></h2>

<p class="noi">As the Author of this was an Eye-witness and Sharer of the
Particulars in the former Chapter; so, to furnish the Reader with
Accounts as authentick, and which he has as much cause to
depend upon as if he had seen them, he has the several Particulars
following from like Eye-witnesses; and that in such a manner,
as I think their Testimony is not to be question'd, most of the
Gentlemen being of Piety and Reputation.</p>

<p>And as a Publication was made to desire all Persons who
were willing to contribute to the forwarding this Work, and to
transmit the Memory of so signal a Judgment to Posterity, that
they would be pleas'd to send up such authentick Accounts
of the Mischiefs, Damages, and Disasters in their respective
Counties that the World might rely on; it cannot, without a
great breach of Charity, be suppos'd that Men mov'd by such
Principles, without any private Interest or Advantage, would
forge any thing to impose upon the World, and abuse Mankind
in Ages to come.</p>

<p>Interest, Parties, Strife, Faction, and particular Malice, with
all the scurvy Circumstances attending such things, may prompt
Men to strain a Tale beyond its real Extent; but, that Men
shou'd invent a Story to amuse Posterity, in a case where they
have no manner of Motive, where the only Design is to preserve
the Remembrance of Divine Vengeance, and put our Children
in mind of God's Judgments upon their sinful Fathers, this
would be telling a Lye for God's sake, and doing Evil for the
sake of it self, which is a step beyond the Devil.</p>

<p>Besides, as most of our Relators have not only given us their
Names, and sign'd the Accounts they have sent, but have also
given us Leave to hand their Names down to Posterity with the
Record of the Relation they give, we would hope no Man will
be so uncharitable to believe that Men would be forward to
set their Names to a voluntary Untruth, and have themselves
recorded to Posterity for having, without Motion, Hope,
Reward, or any other reason, impos'd a Falsity upon the World,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>and dishonour'd our Relation with the useless Banter of an
Untruth.</p>

<p>We cannot therefore but think, that as the Author believes
himself sufficiently back'd by the Authority of the Vouchers he
presents, so after what has been here premis'd, no Man will
have any room to suspect us of Forgery.</p>

<p>The ensuing Relation therefore, as to Damages in the Country,
shall consist chiefly of Letters from the respective Places where
such things have happen'd; only that as all our Letters are not
concise enough to be printed as they are, where it is otherwise
the Letter is digested into a Relation only; in which the Reader
is assur'd we have always kept close to the matter of fact.</p>

<p>And first, I shall present such Accounts as are entire, and
related by Men of Letters, principally by the Clergy; which shall
be given you in their own Words.</p>

<p>The first is from <em>Stowmarket</em> in <em>Suffolk</em>, where, by the Violence
of the Storm, the finest Spire in that County, and but new
built, <em>viz.</em> within thirty Years, was overthrown, and fell upon
the Church. The Letter is sign'd by the reverend Minister of the
Place, and vouched by two of the principal Inhabitants, as
follows.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="salutation"><em>SIR</em>,</p>

<p class="noi">Having seen an Advertisement of a Design to perpetuate the
Remembrance of the late dreadful Storm, by publishing a Collection
of all the remarkable Accidents occasion'd by it, and supposing
the Damage done to our Church to be none of the least, we
were willing to contribute something to your Design, by sending
you an Account thereof as follows.</p>

<p>We had formerly a Spire of Timber covered with Lead, of the
height of 77 Foot; which being in danger of falling, was taken
down: and in the Year 1674, with the Addition of 10 Loads of
new Timber, 21 thousand and 8 hundred weight of Lead, a new
one was erected, 100 Foot high from the Steeple, with a Gallery
at the height of 40 Foot all open, wherein hung a Clock-Bell of
between 2 and 3 hundred Weight. The Spire stood but 8 Yards
above the Roof of the Church; and yet by the extreme Violence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>of the Storm, a little before 6 in the Morning the Spire was thrown
down; and carrying with it all the Battlements on the East side, it
fell upon the Church at the distance of 28 Foot; for so much is
the distance between the Steeple and the first Breach, which is on
the North-side of the middle Roof, of the length of 17 Foot, where
it brake down 9 Spars clean, each 23 Foot long, and severally
supported with very strong Braces. The Spire inclining to the
North, fell cross the middle Wall, and broke off at the Gallery,
the lower part falling in at the aforesaid Breach, and the upper
upon the North Isle, which is 24 Foot wide, with a flat Roof lately
built, all new and very strong: It carried all before it from side to
side, making a Breach 37 Foot long, breaking in sunder two large
Beams that went a-cross, which were 12 Inches broad and 15
deep, besides several other smaller. Besides these two Breaches,
there is a great deal of Damage done by the Fall of great Stones
upon other parts of the Roof, as well as by the Wind's riving up
the Lead, and a third part of the Pews broken all in pieces, every
thing falling into the Church, except the Weather-cock, which
was found in the Church-yard, at a considerable distance, in the
great Path that goes cross by the East End of the Church. It will
cost above 400 <em>l.</em> to make all good as it was before. There were
3 single Chimneys blown down, and a Stack of 4 more together,
all about the same time; and some others so shaken, that they
were forc'd to be pull'd down; but, we thank God, no body hurt,
tho' one Bed was broken in pieces that was very oft lain in: no
body lay in it that Night. Most Houses suffered something in their
Tiling, and generally all round the Country, there is incredible
Damage done to Churches, Houses, and Barns.</p>

<p class="noi">From <em>Oxfordshire</em> we have an Account very authentick, and yet
unaccountably strange: but the reverend Author of the Story
being a Gentleman whose Credit we cannot dispute, in acknowledgment
to his Civility, and for the Advantage of our true
Design, we give his Letter also <em>verbatim</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="salutation"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>

<em>SIR</em>,</p>

<p class="noi">Meeting with an Advertisement of yours in the <em>Gazette</em> of <em>Monday</em>
last, I very much approved of the Design, thinking it might be a
great Motive towards making People, when they hear the Fate of
others, return Thanks to Almighty God for his Providence in
preserving them. I accordingly was resolved to send you all I
knew. The Place where I have for some time lived is <em>Besselsleigh</em>,
in <em>Barkshire</em>, about four Miles S.W. of <em>Oxon</em>. The Wind began
with us much about One of the Clock in the Morning, and did
not do much harm, only in untiling Houses, blowing down a
Chimney or two, without any Person hurt, and a few Trees: but
what was the only thing that was strange, and to be observed,
was a very tall Elm, which was found the next Morning standing,
but perfectly twisted round; the Root a little loosen'd, but not
torn up. But what happened the Afternoon preceding, is abundantly
more surprizing, and is indeed the Intent of this Letter.</p>

<p>On <em>Friday</em> the 26th of <em>November</em>, in the Afternoon, about Four
of the Clock, a Country Fellow came running to me in a great
Fright, and very earnestly entreated me to go and see a Pillar, as
he call'd it, in the Air, in a Field hard by. I went with the Fellow;
and when I came, found it to be a Spout marching directly with
the Wind: and I can think of nothing I can compare it to better
than the Trunk of an Elephant, which it resembled, only much
bigger. It was extended to a great Length, and swept the Ground
as it went, leaving a Mark behind. It crossed a Field; and what
was very strange (and which I should scarce have been induced
to believe had I not my self seen it, besides several Country-men
who were astonish'd at it) meeting with an Oak that stood
towards the middle of the Field snapped the Body of it asunder.
Afterwards crossing a Road, it sucked up the Water that was in
the Cart-ruts: then coming to an old Barn, it tumbled it down,
and the Thatch that was on the Top was carried about by the
Wind, which was then very high, in great confusion. After this I
followed it no farther, and therefore saw no more of it. But a
Parishoner of mine going from hence to <em>Hinksey</em>, in a Field about
a quarter of a Mile off of this Place, was on the sudden knock'd
down, and lay upon the Place till some People came by and
brought him home; and he is not yet quite recovered. Having
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>examined him, by all I can collect both from the Time, and Place,
and Manner of his being knock'd down, I must conclude it was
done by the Spout, which, if its Force had not been much abated,
had certainly kill'd him: and indeed I attribute his Illness more to
the Fright, than the sudden Force with which he was struck down.</p>

<p>I will not now enter into a Dissertation on the Cause of Spouts,
but by what I can understand they are caused by nothing but the
Circumgyration of the Clouds, made by two contrary Winds
meeting in a Point, and condensing the Cloud till it falls in the
Shape we see it; which by the twisting Motion sucks up Water,
and doth much Mischief to Ships at Sea, where they happen oftner
than at Land. Whichever of the two Winds prevails, as in the
above-mentioned was the S.W. at last dissolves and dissipates
the Cloud, and then the Spout disappears.</p>

<p>This is all I have to communicate to you, wishing you all
imaginable Success in your Collection. Whether you insert this
Account, I leave wholly to your own Discretion; but can assure
you, that to most of these things, tho' very surprizing, I was my
self an Eye-witness. I am,</p>

<p class="noi">The judicious Reader will observe here, that this strange Spout,
or Cloud, or what else it may be call'd, was seen the Evening
before the great Storm: from whence is confirm'd what I have
said before of the violent Agitation of the Air for some time
before the Tempest.</p>

<p>A short, but very regular Account, from <em>Northampton</em>, the
Reader may take in the following Letter; the Person being of
undoubted Credit and Reputation in the Town, and the Particulars
very well worth remark.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="salutation"><em>SIR</em>,</p>

<p class="noi">Having seen in the <em>Gazette</em> an Intimation, that there would be a
Memorial drawn up of the late terrible Wind, and the Effects of
it, and that the Composer desired Informations from credible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>Persons, the better to enable him to do the same, I thought good
to intimate what happen'd in this Town, and its Neighbourhood.
1. The Weather-cock of <em>All-Saints</em> Church being placed on a
mighty Spindle of Iron, was bowed together, and made useless.
Many Sheets of Lead on that Church, as also on St. <em>Giles</em>'s and
St. <em>Sepulchres</em>, rowled up like a Scroll. Three Windmills belonging
to the Town blown down, to the Amazement of all Beholders; the
mighty upright Post below the Floor of the Mills being snapt in
two like a Reed. Two entire Stacks of Chimneys in a House
uninhabited fell on two several Roofs, and made a most amazing
Ruin in the Chambers, Floors, and even to the lower Windows
and Wainscot, splitting and tearing it as if a Blow by Gun-powder
had happen'd. The Floods at this instant about the South Bridge,
from a violent S.W. Wind, rose to a great and amazing height;
the Wind coming over or a-thwart large open Meadows, did
exceeding damage in that part of the Town, by blowing down
some whole Houses, carrying whole Roofs at once into the Streets,
and very many lesser Buildings of Tanners, Fell-mongers, Dyers,
Glue-makers, <em>&amp;c.</em> yet, through the Goodness of God, no Person
killed or maimed: the mighty Doors of the Sessions-house, barr'd
and lock'd, forced open, whereby the Wind entring, made a
miserable Havock of the large and lofty Windows: a Pinnacle on
the <em>Guild-hall</em>, with the Fane, was also blown down. To speak
of Houses shatter'd, Corn-ricks and Hovels blown from their
Standings, would be endless. In Sir <em>Thomas Samwell</em>'s Park a very
great headed Elm was blown over the Park-Wall into the Road,
and yet never touched the Wall, being carried some Yards. I have
confined my self to this Town. If the Composer finds any thing
agreeable to his Design, he may use it or dismiss it at his Discretion.
Such Works of Providence are worth recording. I am</p>

<p class="noi">The following Account from <em>Berkly</em> and other Places in <em>Gloucestershire</em>
and <em>Somersetshire</em>, &amp;c. are the sad Effects of the
prodigious Tide in the <em>Severn</em>. The Wind blowing directly into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>the Mouth of that Channel we call the <em>Severn</em> Sea, forced the
Waters up in such quantity, that 'tis allow'd the Flood was eight
Foot higher than ever was known in the Memory of Man; and
at one Place, near <em>Huntspill</em>, it drove several Vessels a long way
upon the Land; from whence, no succeeding Tide rising to near
that height, they can never be gotten off: as will appear in the
two following Letters.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="salutation"><em>SIR</em>,</p>

<p class="noi">This Parish is a very large one in the County of <em>Gloucester</em>, on
one Side whereof runneth the River <em>Severn</em>, which by Reason of
the Violence of the late Storm beat down and tore to pieces the
Sea Wall (which is made of great Stones, and Sticks which they
call Rouses; a Yard and half long, about the Bigness of ones
Thigh rammed into the Ground as firm as possible) in many
Places, and levell'd it almost with the Ground, forcing vast Quantities
of Earth a great Distance from the Shore, and Stones, many
of which were above a Hundred Weight: and hereby the <em>Severn</em>
was let in above a Mile over one part of the Parish, and did great
Damage to the Land; it carried away one House which was by
the Sea-side, and a Gentleman's Stable, wherein was a Horse, into
the next Ground; and then the Stable fell to pieces, and so the
Horse came out. There is one thing more remarkable in this
Parish, and 'tis this: Twenty Six Sheets of Lead, hanging all
together, were blown off from the middle Isle of our Church, and
were carried over the North Isle, which is a very large one, without
touching it; and into the Church-yard ten Yards distant from the
Church; and they were took up all joyned together as they were
on the Roof; the Plummer told me that the Sheets weighed each
Three Hundred and a half one with another. This is what is most
observable in our Parish; but I shall give you an Account of one
thing (which perhaps you may have from other Hands) that
happen'd in another, call'd <em>Kingscote</em>, a little Village about Three
Miles from <em>Tedbury</em>, and Seven from us; where <em>William Kingscote</em>
Esq; has many Woods; among which was one Grove of very tall
Trees, being each near Eighty Foot high; the which he greatly
valued for the Tallness and Prospect of them, and therefore
resolv'd never to cut them down: But it so happen'd, that Six
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>Hundred of them, within the Compass of Five Acres were wholly
blown down; (and suppos'd to be much at the same time) each
Tree tearing up the Ground with its Root; so that the Roots of
most of the Trees, with the Turf and Earth about them, stood up
at least Fifteen or Sixteen Foot high; the lying down of which
Trees is an amazing Sight to all Beholders. This Account was
given by the Gentleman himself, whom I know very well. I have
no more to add, but that I am, <em>Your humble Servant</em>, wishing you
good Success in your Undertaking,</p>

<p class="salutation p4"><em>SIR</em>,</p>

<p class="noi">I Received a printed Paper sometime since, wherein I was desired
to send you an Account of what happen'd in the late Storm: and
I should have answered it sooner, but was willing to make some
Enquiry first about this County; and by what I can hear or
learn, the dismal Accident of our late Bishop and Lady was most
remarkable; who was killed by the Fall of two Chimney Stacks,
which fell on the Roof, and drove it in upon my Lord's Bed,
forced it quite through the next Flower down into the Hall, and
buried them both in the Rubbish; and 'tis suppos'd my Lord was
getting up, for he was found some Distance from my Lady, who
was found in her Bed; but my Lord had his Morning Gown on,
so that 'tis suppos'd he was coming from the Bed just as it fell.
We had likewise two small Houses blown flat down just as the
People were gone out to a Neighbour's House; and several other
Chimney Stacks fell down, and some through the Roof, but no
other Accident as to Death in this Town or near it: abundance of
Tiles are blown off, and likewise Thatch in and about this Town,
and several Houses uncover'd, in the Country all about us, abundance
of Apple and Elm Trees are rooted up by the Ground;
and also abundance of Wheat and Hay-mows blown down: at
<em>Huntspil</em>, about twelve Miles from this Town, there was Four or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>Five small Vessels drove a-shoar which remain there still, and 'tis
suppos'd cannot be got off; and in the same Parish, the Tide broke
in Breast high; but all the People escap'd only one Woman, who
was drowned. These are all the remarkable Things that happen'd
near us, as I can hear of; and is all, but my humble Service; and

<p class="salutation p4"><em>SIR</em>,</p>

<p class="noi">The Dreadful Storm did this Church but little Damage, but our
Houses were terribly shaken hereabouts, and the Tide drowned
the greatest part of the Sheep on our Common; as it likewise
did, besides many Cows, between this Place and <em>Bristol</em>; on the
opposite Shore of <em>Glamorganshire</em>, as (I suppose you may also
know) it brake down part of <em>Chepstow</em> Bridge, o'er the <em>Wye</em>. In
the midst of this Church-yard grew a vast Tree, thought to be the
most large and flourishing Elm in the Land which was torn up by
the Roots, some of which are really bigger than ones Middle, and
several than a Man's Thigh; the Compass of them curiously
interwoven with the Earth, being from the Surface (or Turf) to
the Basis, full an Ell in Depth, and Eighteen Foot and half in the

<blockquote>

<p class="salutation p4"><em>Honour'd Sir</em>,</p>

<p class="noi">In Obedience to your Request I have here sent you a particular
Account of the damages sustain'd in our Parish by the late Violent
Storm; and because that of our Church is the most material which
I have to impart to you, I shall therefore begin with it. It is the
fineness of our Church which magnifies our present loss, for in
the whole it is a large and noble structure, compos'd within and
without of Ashler curiously wrought, and consisting of a stately
Roof in the middle, and two Isles runing a considerable length
from one end of it to the other, makes a very beautiful Figure. It
is also adorn'd with 28 admired and Celebrated Windows, which,
for the variety and fineness of the Painted Glass that was in them,
do justly attract the Eyes of all curious Travellers to inspect and
behold them; nor is it more famous for its Glass, than newly
renown'd for the Beauty of its Seats and Paving, both being chiefly
the noble Gift of that pious and worthy Gentleman <em>Andrew
Barker</em>, Esq; the late Deceas'd Lord of the Mannor. So that all
things consider'd, it does equal, at least, if not exceed, any Parochial
Church in <em>England</em>. Now that part of it which most of all
felt the fury of the Winds, was, a large middle West Window, in
Dimension about 15 Foot wide, and 25 Foot high: it represents
the general Judgment, and is so fine a piece of Art, that 1500 <em>l.</em>
has formerly been bidden for it, a price, though very tempting,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>yet were the Parishoners so just and honest as to refuse it. The
upper part of this Window, just above the place where our
Saviour's Picture is drawn sitting on a Rainbow, and the Earth
his Foot-stool, is entirely ruin'd, and both sides are so shatter'd
and torn, especially the left, that upon a general Computation, a
fourth part, at least, is blown down and destroy'd. The like Fate
has another West Window on the left side of the former, in
Dimension about 10 Foot broad, and 15 Foot high, sustain'd; the
upper half of which is totally broke, excepting one Stone Munnel.
Now if this were but ordinary Glass, we might quickly
compute what our repairs would Cost, but we the more lament
our misfortune herein, because the Paint of these two, as of all
the other Windows in our Church, is stain'd thro' the Body of the
Glass; so that if that be true which is generally said, that this Art
is lost, then have we an irretrievable loss. There are other damages
about our Church, which, tho' not so great as the former, do yet
as much testify how strong and boisterous the Winds were, for
they unbedded 3 Sheets of Lead upon the uppermost Roof, and
roll'd them up like so much Paper. Over the Church-porch, a
large Pinnacle and two Battlements were blown down upon the
leads of it, but resting there, and their fall being short, these will
be repair'd with little Cost. This is all I have to say concerning
our Church: Our Houses come next to be considered, and here I
may tell you, that (thanks be to God) the effects of the Storm were
not so great as they have been in many other places; several
Chimneys, and Tiles, and Slats, were thrown down, but no body
kill'd or wounded. Some of the Poor, because their Houses were
Thatch'd, were the greatest sufferers; but to be particular herein,
would be very frivolous, as well as vexatious. One Instance of
Note ought not to omitted; on <em>Saturday</em> the 26th, being the day
after the Storm, about 2-a-Clock in the Afternoon, without any
previous warning, a sudden flash of Lightning, with a short,
but violent clap of Thunder, immediately following it like the
Discharge of Ordnance, fell upon a new and strong built House
in the middle of our Town, and at the same time disjointed two
Chimneys, melted some of the Lead of an upper Window, and
struck the Mistress of the House into a Swoon, but this, as
appear'd afterwards, prov'd the effect more of fear, than of any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>real considerable hurt to be found about her. I have nothing more
to add, unless it be the fall of several Trees and Ricks of Hay
amongst us, but these being so common every where, and not
very many in number here, I shall Conclude this tedious Scrible,
and Subscribe my self,</p>

dreadful Tempest of Wind, and in the first Place is the Copy of a
Letter from a Brother of mine, that was an Exciseman of <em>Axbridge</em>,
in the West of our County of <em>Somerset</em>; these are his Words,</p>

<p>What I know of the Winds in these Parts, are, that it broke
down many Trees, and that the House of one <em>Richard Henden</em>;
of <em>Charter-House</em> on <em>Mendip</em>, call'd <em>Piney</em>, was almost blown
down, and in saving their House, they, and the Servants, and
others, heard grievous Cries and Scrieches in the Air. The Tower
of <em>Compton Bishop</em> was much shatter'd, and the Leads that
cover'd it were taken clean away, and laid flat in the Church-Yard:
The House of <em>John Cray</em> of that place, received much and strange
Damages, which together with his part in the Sea-wall, amounted
to 500 <em>l.</em> Near the Salt-works in the Parish of <em>Burnham</em>, was
driven five trading Vessels, as Colliers and Corn-dealers, betwixt
<em>Wales</em> and <em>Bridgwater</em>, at least 100 Yards on Pasture Ground. In
the North Marsh, on the sides of <em>Bristol</em> River, near <em>Ken</em> at
<em>Walton Woodspring</em>, the Waters broke with such Violence, that
it came six Miles into the Country drowning much Cattel, carrying
away several Hay-ricks and Stacks of Corn: And at a Farm at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span><em>Churchill</em> near <em>Wrington</em>, it blew down 150 Elms that grew
most in Rows, and were laid as Uniform as Soldiers lodge their
Arms.</p>

<p>At <em>Cheddar</em> near <em>Axbridge</em>, was much harm done in Apple-trees,
Houses, and such like; but what's worth remark, tho' not
the very Night of the Tempest, a Company of wicked People
being at a Wedding of one <em>Thomas Marshall</em>, <em>John</em>, the Father of
the said <em>Thomas</em>, being as most of the Company was very Drunk,
after much filthy Discourse while he was eating, a strange Cat
pulling something from his Trenchard, he Cursing her, stoopt
to take it up, and died immediately.</p>

<p>At <em>Brewton</em> what was most Remarkable, was this, that one
<em>John Dicer</em> of that Town, lay the Night as the Tempest was, in
the Barn of one <em>John Seller</em>, the Violence of the Wind broke down
the Roof of the Barn, but fortunately for him there was a Ladder
which staid up a Rafter, which would have fell upon the said
<em>John Dicer</em>; but he narrowly escaping being killed, did slide
himself thro' the broken Roof, and so got over the Wall without
any great hurt. What hurt was done more about that Town is
not so considerable as in other Places; Such as blowing off the
Thatch from a great many back Houses of the Town; for the
Town is most tiled with a sort of heavy Tile, that the Wind had
no power to move; there was some hurt done to the Church,
which was not above 40<em>s.</em> besides the Windows, where was a
considerable damage, the Lady <em>Fitzharding</em>'s House standing by
the Church, the Battlement with part of the Wall of the House
was blown down, which 'tis said, above 20 Men with all their
strength could not have thrown down; besides, a great many
Trees in the Park torn up by the Roots, and laid in very good
Order one after another; it was taken notice that the Wind did
not come in a full Body at once, but it came in several Gusts, as
my self have taken Notice as I rid the Country, that in half a Miles
riding I could not see a Tree down, nor much hurt to Houses,
then again I might for some space see the Trees down, and all the
Houses shattred: and I have taken Notice that it run so all up the
Country in such a Line as the Wind sat; about One of the Clock
it turn'd to the North West, but at the beginning was at South
West; I my self was up until One and then I went to Bed, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>the highest of the Wind was after that, so that my Bed did shake
with me.</p>

<p class="noi p2">What was about <em>Wincanton</em>, was, that one Mrs. <em>Gapper</em> had 36
Elm-trees growing together in a Row, 35 of them was blown
down; and one <em>Edgehill</em> of the same Town, and his Family being
a Bed did arise, hearing the House begin to Crak, and got out of
the Doors with his whole Family, and as soon as they were out
the Roof of the House fell in, and the Violence of the Wind
took of the Children's Head-cloaths, that they never saw them
afterwards.</p>

<p class="noi p2">At <em>Evercreech</em>, three Miles from <em>Brewton</em>, there were a poor
Woman beg'd for Lodging in the Barn of one <em>Edmond Peny</em> that
same Night that the Storm was, she was wet the Day before in
Travelling, so she hung up her Cloaths in the Barn, and lay in the
Straw; but when the Storm came it blew down the Roof of the
Barn where she lay, and she narrowly escaped with her Life, being
much bruised, and got out almost naked through the Roof where
it was broken most, and went to the dwelling House of the said
<em>Edmond Peny</em>, and they did arise, and did help her to something
to cover her, till they could get out her Cloaths; that place of
<em>Evercreech</em> received a great deal of hurt in their Houses, which is
too large to put here.</p>

<p class="noi p2">At <em>Batcomb</em> Easterly of <em>Evercreech</em>, they had a great deal of
Damage done as I said before, it lay exactly with the Wind from
<em>Evercreech</em>, and both places received a great deal of Damage;
there was one Widow <em>Walter</em> lived in a House by it self, the Wind
carried away the Roof, and the Woman's pair of Bodice, that was
never heard of again, and the whole Family escaped narrowly
with their Lives; all the Battlements of the Church on that side of
the Tower next to the Wind was blown in, and a great deal of
Damage done to the Church.</p>

<p>At <em>Shipton Mallet</em> was great Damages done, as I was told by
the Post that comes to <em>Brewton</em>, that the Tiles of the Meeting
House was blown off, and being a sort of light Tiles they flew
against the Neighbouring Windows, and broke them to pieces:

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
And at <em>Chalton</em> near <em>Shepton Mallet</em> at one <em>Abbot</em>'s, the Roof
was carried from the Walls of the House and the House mightily
shaken, and seemingly the Foundation removed, and in the
Morning they found a Foundation Stone of the House upon the
top of the Wall, where was a shew in the Ground of its being
driven out. At <em>Dinder</em> within two Miles of <em>Shepton</em>, there was
one <em>John Allen</em>, and his Son, being out of Doors in the midst of
the Tempest, they saw a great Body of Fire flying on the side of a
Hill, call'd <em>Dinder-hill</em>, about half a Mile from them, with a Shew
of black in the midst of it, and another Body of Fire following it,
something smaller than the former.</p>

<p>There has been a strange thing at <em>Butly</em>, eight Miles from
<em>Brewton</em>, which was thought to be Witchcraft, where a great
many unusual Things happened to one <em>Pope</em>, and his Family,
especially to a Boy, that was his Son, that having lain several
Hours Dead, when he came to himself, he told his Father, and
several of his Neighbours, Strange Stories of his being carried
away by some of his Neighbours that have been counted wicked
Persons; the Things have been so strangely related that Thousands
of People have gone to see and hear it; it lasted about a Year or
more: But since the Storm I have inquired of the Neighbours how
it was, and they tell me, that since the late Tempest of Wind the
House and People have been quiet; for its generally said, that
there was some Conjuration in quieting of that House. If you
have a desire to hear any farther Account of it, I will make it my
Business to inquire farther of it, for there were such. Things
happened in that time which is seldom heard of,</p>

<p class="salutation p4"><em>SIR</em>,</p>

<p class="noi">I received yours, desiring an Account of the Damage done by
the late great Wind about us. At <em>Wilsnorton</em>, three Miles from
<em>Wittney</em>, the Lead of the Church was rouled, and great Damage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>done to the Church, many great Elms were tore up by the Roots:
At <em>Helford</em>, two Miles from us, a Rookery of Elms, was most of
it tore up by the Roots: At <em>Cockeup</em>, two Miles from us, was a
Barn blown down, and several Elms blown down a Cross the
High-way, so that there was no passage; a great Oak of about
nine or ten Loads was blown down, having a Raven sitting in
it, his Wing-feathers got between two Bows, and held him fast;
but the Raven received no hurt: At <em>Duckelton</em>, a little thatch't
House was taken off the Ground-pening, and removed a distance
from the place, the covering not damaged. Hay-recks abundance
are torn to pieces: At <em>Wittney</em>, six Stacks of Chimneys blown
down, one House had a sheet of Lead taken from one side and
blown over to the other, and many Houses were quite torn to
pieces; several Hundred Trees blown down, some broke in the
middle, and some torn up by the Roots. Blessed be God, I hear
neither Man, Woman nor Child that received any harm about us.</p>

<p class="noi"><em>Brief but exact Remarks on the late Dreadful Storms of Wind,
as it affected the Town, and the Parts adjacent.</em></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="noi"><em>Imprimus.</em> At <em>Ashil</em>-Parish 3 Miles West from this Town, the
Stable belonging to the Hare and Hounds Inn was blown down,
in which were three Horses, one kill'd, another very much bruised.</p>

<p>2. At <em>Jurdans</em>, a Gentleman's Seat in the same Parish, there was
a Brick Stable, whose Roof, one Back, and one End Wall, were
all thrown down, and four foot in depth of the Fore Wall; in this
Stable were 4 Horses, which by reason of the Hay-loft that bore
up the Roof, were all preserv'd.</p>

<p>3. At <em>Sevington</em> Parish, three Miles East from this Town, <em>John</em>
Hutkens had the Roof of a new built House heaved clean off
the Walls. <em>Note</em>, the House was not glazed, and the Roof was
thatch'd.</p>

<p>4. In <em>White Larkington</em> Park, a Mile East from this Town,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>besides four or five hundred tall Trees broken and blown down,
(admirable to behold, what great Roots was turned up) there
were three very large Beaches, two of them that were near five
Foot thick in the Stem were broken off, one of them near the
Root, the other was broken off twelve Foot above, and from that
place down home to the Root was shattered and flown; the other
that was not broken, cannot have less than forty Waggon Loads
in it; a very fine Walk of Trees before the House all blown down,
and broke down the Roof of a Pidgeon House, the Rookery
carried away in Lanes, the Lodg-House damaged in the Roof, and
one End by the fall of Trees. In the Garden belonging to the
House, was a very fine Walk of tall Firrs, twenty of which were
broken down.</p>

<p>5. The damage in the Thatch of Houses, (which is the usual
Covering in these Parts) is so great and general, that the price of
Reed arose from twenty Shillings to fifty or three Pounds a Hundred;
insomuch that to shelter themselves from the open Air,
many poor People were glad to use Bean, Helm and Furse, to
thatch their Houses with, Things never known to be put to such
Use before.</p>

<p>6. At <em>Kingston</em>, a Mile distance from this Town, the Church
was very much shattered in its Roof, and Walls too, and all
our Country Churches much shattered, so that Churches and
Gentlemen's Houses which were tiled, were so shatter'd in
their Roofs, that at present, they are generally patch'd with Reed,
not in Compliance with the Mode, but the Necessity of the Times.</p>

<p>7. At <em>Broadway</em>, two Miles West of this Town, <em>Hugh Betty</em>,
his Wife, and four Children being in his House, it was by the
violence of the Storm blown down, one of his Children killed, his
Wife wounded, but recovered, the rest escaped with their Lives.
A large Alms-house had most of the Tile blown off, and other
Houses much shattered; a very large Brick Barn blown down,
Walls and Roof to the Ground.</p>

<p>8. Many large Stacks of Wheat were broken, some of the
Sheaves carried two or three Hundred Yards from the Place, many
Stacks of Hay turned over, some Stacks of Corn heaved off the
Stadle, and set down on the Ground, and not broken.</p>

<p>9. <em>Dowlish Walk</em>, two Miles South East, the Church was very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>much shattered, several Load of Stones fell down, not as yet
repair'd, therefore can't express the damage. A very large Barn
broken down that stood near the Church, much damage was done
to Orchards, not only in this Place, but in all places round, some
very fine Orchards quite destroyed: some to their great Cost had
the Trees set up right again, but a Storm of Wind came after,
which threw down many of the Trees again; as to Timber Trees,
almost all our high Trees were broken down in that violent Storm.</p>

<p>10. In this Town <em>Henry Dunster</em>, his Wife and 2 Children, was
in their House when it was blown down, but they all escaped
with their Lives, only one of them had a small Bruise with a piece
of Timber, as she was going out of the Chamber when the Roof
broke in.</p>

<p>The Church, in this Place, scap'd very well, as to its Roof, being
cover'd with Lead only on the Chancel; the Lead was at the top
of the Roof heaved up, and roll'd together, more than ten Men
could turn back again, without cutting the Sheets of Lead, which
was done to put it in its place again: But in general the Houses
much broken and shatter'd, besides the fall of some.</p>

<p>This is a short, but true Account. I have heard of several other
things which I have not mentioned, because I could not be positive
in the truth of them, unless I had seen it. This is what I have been
to see the truth of. You may enlarge on these short Heads, and
methodize 'em as you see good.</p>

<p>At <em>Henton St. George</em>, at the Lord <em>Pawlet</em>'s, a new Brick Wall
was broken down by the Wind for above 100 foot, the Wall being
built not above 2 years since, as also above 60 Trees near 100
foot high.</p>

<p>At <em>Barrington</em>, about 2 miles North of this Town, there was
blown down above eight-score Trees, being of an extraordinary
height, at the Lady <em>Strouds.</em></p></blockquote>

<em>From</em> Wiltshire <em>we have the following Account from the Reverend
the Minister of Upper</em> Donhead <em>near</em> Shaftsbury; <em>to which
the Reader is referr'd as follows.</em></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="salutation"><em>SIR</em>,</p>

<p class="noi">As the Undertaking you are engag'd in, to preserve the Remembrance
of the late dreadful Tempest, is very commendable in it
self, and may in several respects be serviceable not only to the
present Age, but also to Posterity; so it merits a suitable Encouragement,
and, 'tis hop'd, it will meet with such, from all that have
either a true sense of Religion, or have had any sensible share of
the care of Providence over them, or of the goodness of God unto
them in the Land of the Living, upon that occasion. There are
doubtless vast numbers of People in all Parts (where the Tempest
raged) that have the greatest reason (as the Author of this Paper
for one hath) to bless God for their wonderful preservation, and
to tell it to the Generation following. But to detain you no longer
with Preliminaries, I shall give you a faithful Account of what
occurr'd in my Neighbourhood (according to the Conditions
mention'd in the Advertisement in the <em>Gazette</em>) worthy, at least,
of my notice, if not of the Undertakers; and I can assure you, that
the several Particulars were either such as I can vouch-for on my
own certain Knowledge and Observation, or else such as I am
satisfy'd of the truth of by the Testimony of others, whose Integrity
I have no reason to suspect. I will say no more than this in
general, concerning the Storm, that, at its height, it seem'd, for
some hours, to be a perfect Hurrican, the Wind raging from every
Quarter, especially from all the Points of the Compass, from <em>N.E.</em>
to the <em>N.W.</em> as the dismal Effects of it in these Parts do evidently
demonstrate, in the demolishing of Buildings (or impairing 'em
at best) and in the throwing up vast numbers of Trees by the
Roots, or snapping them off in their Bodies, or larger Limbs. But
as to some remarkable Particulars, you may take these following,
<em>viz.</em></p>

<p>1. The Parish-Church receiv'd little damage, tho' it stands high,
the chief was in some of the Windows on the N. side, and in the
fall of the Top-stone of one of the Pinnacles, which fell on a
House adjoining to the Tower with little hurt to the Roof, from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>which glancing it rested on the Leads of the South-Isle of the
Church. At the fall of it an aged Woman living in the said House
on which the Stone fell, heard horrible Scrieches (as she constantly
averrs) in the Air, but none before nor afterwards.</p>

<p>2. Two stone Chimney-tops were thrown down, and 2 broad
Stones of each of them lay at even poize on the respective ridges
of both the Houses, and tho' the Wind sat full against one of them
to have thrown it off, (and then it had fallen over a Door, in and
out at which several People were passing during the Storm) and
tho' the other fell against the Wind, yet neither of the said Stones
stirr'd.</p>

<p>3. A Stone of near 400 Weight, having lain about 7 Years under
a Bank, defended from the Wind as it then sat, tho' it lay so long
as to be fix'd in the ground, and was as much out of the Wind, as
could be, being fenced by the Bank, and a low Stone-wall upon
the Bank, none of which was demolish'd, tho' 2 small Holms
standing in the Bank between the Wall, and the Stone, at the foot
of the Bank were blown up by the roots; I say, this Stone, tho'
thus fenced from the Storm, was carried from the place where it
lay, into an hollow-way beneath, at least seven Yards from the
place, where it was known to have lain for 7 Years before.</p>

<p>4. A Widdow-woman living in one part of an House by her
self, kept her Bed till the House over her was uncover'd, and she
expected the fall of the Timber and Walls; but getting below Stairs
in the dark, and opening the Door to fly for shelter, the Wind was
so strong in the Door, that she could neither get out at it, tho' she
attempted to go out on her knees and hands, nor could she shut
the Door again with all her strength, but was forced to sit alone
for several hours ('till the Storm slacken'd), fearing every Gust
would have buried her in the Ruins; and yet it pleas'd God to
preserve her, for the House (tho' a feeble one) stood over the
Storm.</p>

<p>5. Another, who made Malt in his Barn, had been turning his
Malt sometime before the Storm was at its height, and another of
the Family being desirous to go again into the said Barn sometime
after, was disswaded from it, and immediately thereupon the said
Barn was thrown down by the Storm.</p>

<p>6. But a much narrower Escape had one, for whose safety the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>Collector of these Passages has the greatest reason to bless and
praise the great Preserver of Men, who was twice in his Bed that
dismal Night (tho' he had warning sufficient to deter him the first
time by the falling of some of the Seiling on his Back and Shoulders,
as he was preparing to go to Bed) and was altogether
insensible of the great danger he was in, 'till the next morning
after the Day-light appear'd, when he found the Tiles, on the side
of the House opposite to the main Stress of the Weather, blown
up in two places, one of which was over his Beds-head (about
9 foot above it) in which 2 or 3 Laths being broken, let down a
Square of 8 or 10 Stone Tiles upon one single Lath, where they
hung dropping inward a little, and bended the Lath like a Bow,
but fell not: What the consequence of their Fall had been, was
obvious to as many as saw it, and none has more reason to
magnify God's great Goodness, in this rescue of his Providence,
than the Relater.</p>

<p>7. A young Man of the same Parish, who was sent abroad to
look after some black Cattle and Sheep that fed in an Inclosure,
in, or near to which there were some Stacks of Corn blown down,
reports, That tho' he had much difficulty to find the Inclosure in
the dark, and to get thither by reason of the Tempest then raging
in the height of its fury; yet being there, he saw a mighty Body of
Fire on an high ridge of Hills, about 3 parts of a Mile from the
said Inclosure, which gave so clear a Light into the Valley below,
as that by it the said young Man could distinctly descry all the
Sheep and Cattle in the said Pasture, so as to perceive there was
not one wanting.</p>

<p>8. At <em>Ashegrove</em>, in the same Parish (where many tall Trees
were standing on the steep side of an Hill) there were two Trees
of considerable bigness blown up against the side of the Hill,
which seems somewhat strange, to such as have seen how many
are blown, at the same place, a quite contrary way, <em>i.e.</em> down the
Hill; and to fall downwards was to fall with the Wind, as upward,
was to fall against it.</p>

<p>9. One in this Neighbourhood had a Poplar in his Back-side of
near 16 Yards high blown down, which standing near a small
Current of Water, the Roots brought up near a Tun of Earth with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>them, and there the Tree lay for some days after the Storm; but
when the Top or Head of the Tree was saw'd off from the Body
(tho' the Boughs were nothing to the weight of the But End, yet)
the Tree mounted, and fell back into it's place, and stood as
upright without its Head, as ever it had done with it. And the
same happen'd at the Lady <em>Banks</em> her House near <em>Shaftsbury</em>,
where a Wall-nut-Tree was thrown down in a place that declin'd
somewhat, and after the greater Limbs had been cut off in the day
time, went back in the Night following, of it self, and now stands
in the same place and posture it stood in before it was blown
down. I saw it standing the 14th of this Instant, and could hardly
perceive any Token of its having been Down, so very exactly it
fell back into its place. This is somewhat the more remarkable,
because the Ground (as I said) was declining, and consequently
the Tree raised against the Hill. To this I shall only add, at present,
that</p>

<p>10. This Relator lately riding thro' a neighbouring Parish, saw
two Trees near two Houses thrown besides the said Houses, and
very near each House, which yet did little or no harm, when if
they had fallen with the Wind, they must needs have fallen directly
upon the said Houses. And</p>

<p>11. That this Relator had two very tall Elms thrown up by the
Roots, which fell in among five young Walnut Trees, without
injuring a Twig or Bud of either of them, as rais'd the admiration
of such as saw it.</p>

<p>12. In the same place, the Top of another Elm yet standing,
was carry'd of from the Body of the Tree, a good part of 20 Yards.</p>

<p class="salutation"><em>SIR</em>,</p>

<p class="noi">Publick notice being given of a designed Collection of the most
Prodigious, as well as lamentable Effects of the last dreadful
Tempest of Wind. There are many Persons hereabouts, and I
suppose in many other places, wish all speedy furtherance and
good Success to that so useful and pious Undertaking, for it may
very well be thought to have a good Influence both upon the
present Age, and succeeding Generation, to beget in them a holy
admiration and fear of that tremendous Power and Majesty,
which as one Prophet tells us, <em>Causeth the Vapours to ascend
from the Ends of the Earth, and bringeth the Wind out of his
Treasures, and as the Priest Saith, hath so done his marvellous
Works, that they ought to be had in remembrance</em>. As to these
Villages of <em>Littleton</em> in <em>Worcestershire</em>, I can only give this Information,
that this violent Hurricane visited us also in its passage
to the great Terror of the Inhabitants, who although by the
gracious Providence of God all escaped with their Lives and
Limbs, and the main Fabrick of their Houses stood; tho' with
much shaking, and some damage in the Roofs of many of them:
Yet when the Morning Light appeared after that dismal Night,
they were surpris'd with fresh apprehensions of the Dangers
escaped, when they discover'd the sad Havock that was made
among the Trees of their Orchards and Closes, very many Fruit
Trees, and many mighty Elms being torn up, and one Elm above
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>the rest, of very great Bulk and ancient Growth I observed, which
might have defied the Strength of all the Men and Teams in the
Parish, (tho' assaulted in every Branch with Roaps and Chains)
was found torn up by the Roots, all sound, and of vast Strength
and Thickness, and with its fall (as was thought) by the help of
the same impetuous Gusts, broke off in the middle of the Timber
another great Elm its Fellow, and next Neighbour. And that
which may exercise the Thoughts of the Curious, some little
Houses and Out-houses that seemed to stand in the same Current,
and without any visible Burrough or Shelter, escaped in their
Roofs, without any, or very little Damage: What Accidents of
Note hapned in our Neighbouring Parishes, I suppose you may
receive from other Hands. This, (I thank God) is all that I have to
transmit unto you from this place, but that I am a Well-wisher to

<p class="noi">The Wind being South West and by West, it began to blow very
hard at 12 of the Clock at Night, and about four or five in the
Morning <em>Nov.</em> 27, the Hurricane was very terrible; many large
Trees were torn up by the Roots in this Place; the Leads of the
Church were Roll'd up, the Stone Battlements of the Tower were
blown upon the Leads, several Houses and Barns were uncover'd,

<p class="salutation"><em>SIR</em>,</p>

<p class="noi">I find in the Advertisments a Desire to have an Account of what
happen'd remarkable in the late terrible Storm in the Country;
the Stories every where are very many, and several of them such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>as will scarce gain Credit; one of them I send here an Account of
being an Eye Witness, and living upon the place: The Storm here
began on the 26th of <em>Novem.</em> 1703. about 12-a-clock, but the
severest Blasts were between 5 and six in the Morning, and
between Eight and Nine the 27th I went up to the Church, where
I found all the middle Isle clearly stript of the Lead from one End
to the other, and a great many of the Sheets lying on the East End
upon the Church, roll'd up like a piece of Cloth: I found on the
Ground six Sheets of Lead, at least 50 Hundred weight, all joyn'd
together, not the least parted, but as they lay upon the Isle, which
six Sheets of Lead were so carried in the Air by the Wind fifty
Yards and a Foot, measured by a Workman exactly as cou'd be,
from the place of the Isle where they lay, to the place they fell;
and they might have been carried a great way further, had they
not happen'd in their way upon a Tree, struck off an Arm of it
near 17 Yards high; the End of one Sheet was twisted round the
Body of the Tree, and the rest all joyn'd together lay at length,
having broke down the Pales first where the Tree stood, and lay
upon the Pales on the Ground, with one End of them, as I said
before, round the Body of the Tree.</p>

<p>At the same time at <em>Marson</em>, in the County of <em>Warwick</em>,
about 4 Miles from this place, a great Rick of Wheat was blown
off from its Staddles, and set down without one Sheaf remov'd,
or disturb'd, or without standing away 20 Yards from the
place.</p>

<p>If you have a mind to be farther satisfied in this Matter, let me
hear from you, and I will endeavour it: But I am in great hast at
this time, which forces me to be confus'd.</p>

we about us came no ways behind the rest of our Neighbours in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>that mighty Storm or Hurricane. As for our own Parish, very few
Houses or Outhouses escaped. There was in the Parish of <em>Fareham</em>
six Barns blown down, with divers other Outhouses, and many
Trees blown up by the Roots, and other broken off in the middle;
by the fall of a large Elm, a very large Stone Window at the West
End of our Church was broken down; there was but two Stacks
of Chimneys thrown down in all our Parish that I know of, and
those without hurting any Person. There was in a <em>Coppice</em> called
<em>Pupal Coppice</em>, an Oak Tree, of about a Load of Timber, that
was twisted off with the Wind, and the Body that was left standing
down to the very Roots so shivered, that if it were cut into
Lengths, it would fall all in pieces. Notwithstanding so many
Trees, and so much Out-Housing was blown down, I do not hear
of one Beast that was killed or hurt. There was on the <em>Down</em>
called <em>Portsdown</em>, in the Parish of <em>Southwick</em>, within three Miles
of us, a Wind-Mill was blown down, that had not been up very
many Years, with great damage in the said Parish to Mr. <em>Norton</em>,
by the fall of many Chimneys and Trees. The damage sustained
by us in the <em>Healing</em> is such, that we are obliged to make use of
Slit Deals to supply the want of Slats and Tyles until Summer
come to make some. And so much Thatching wanting, that it
cannot be all repaired till after another Harvest. As for Sea Affairs
about us, we had but one Vessel abroad at that time, which was
one <em>John Watson</em>, the Master of which was never heard of yet,
and I am afraid never will; I have just reason to lament her Loss,
having a great deal of Goods aboard of her. If at any time any

suffer'd in comparison but little Damage. The most considerable
was, a Child kill'd in St. <em>Giles</em>'s by the fall of an House; two
Pinnacles taken off from the Top of <em>Magdalen</em> Tower, one from
<em>Merton</em>; about 12 Trees blown down in <em>Christ</em> Church long walk,
some of the Battlements from the Body of the Cathedral, and two

of the great Elm in University Garden was blown off, and a Branch
of the Oak in <em>Magdalen</em> walks; the rest of the Colleges scaped
tolerably well, and the Schools and Theatre intirely. A very
remarkable passage happened at Queen's College, several Sheets
of Lead judged near 6000 <em>l.</em> weight, were taken off from the Top
of Sir <em>J. Williamson</em>'s Buildings, and blown against the West-end
of St. Peter's Church with such Violence, that they broke an
Iron-bar in the Window, making such a prodigious Noise with
the fall, that some who heard it, thought the Tower had been
falling. The rest of our Losses consisted for the most part in

<p class="noi">Our Church, tho' a very large one, suffered no great discernable
Damage. The Lead Roof, by the force of the Wind was strangely
ruffled, but was laid down without any great cost or trouble. Two
well-grown Elms, that stood before a sort of Alms-house in the

that a Relation of some considerable Things which happened in
the late Tempest is intended to be printed, which design I believe
will be well approved of, that the Memory of it may be perpetuated.
I will give you an Account of some of the observable Damages
done in this Parish: The Church which was Til'd is so
shattered, that the Body of it is entirely to be ripp'd. Two Barns,
and a Stable have been blown down; in the latter were 13 Horses,
and none of them hurt, tho' there was but one to be seen when
the Men first came. I have number'd about 20 large Trees blown
down, which stood in the regular Walks in the Park here. It is
said, that all the Trees blown down in both the Parks will make
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>above an hundred Stacks of Wood. A Summer-house which stood
on the East-side of the Bowling-green at <em>Hatfield</em>-House, was
blown against the Wall, and broken, and a large part of it carried
over the Wall, beyond a Cartway into the plowed Grounds. A
great part of the South-wall belonging to one of the Gardens was
levelled with the Ground; tho' it was so strong, that great part of
it continues cemented, tho' it fell upon a Gravel-walk. Several
Things which happened, incline me to think that there was something
of an <em>Hurricane</em>. Part of the fine painted Glass-window in
my Lord <em>Salisbury</em>'s Chapel was broken, tho' it looked towards
the East. The North-side of an House was untiled several Yards
square. In some places the Lead has been raised up, and over one
Portal quite blown off. In <em>Brocket-hall</em> Park belonging to Sir <em>John
Reade</em>, so many Trees are blown down, that lying as they do, they
can scarce be numbred, but by a moderate Computation, they are
said to amount to above a Thousand. The Damages which this
Parish hath sustained, undoubtedly amount to many hundred
Pounds, some of the most considerable I have mentioned to you,
of which I have been in great Measure an Eye-witness, and have
had the rest from Credible Persons, especially the matter of
<em>Brocket-hall</em> Park, it being two Miles out of Town, tho' in this

<p><em>From</em> Kent <em>we have many strange Accounts of the Violence

<p><em>At</em> Whitstable, <em>a small Village on the Mouth of the East Swale

from the Water, and being bourn up in the Air, blew turning

<p><em>We content our selves with relating only the Fact, and giving

together, and blown off from the Church above 20 Rod distance,

<p><em>At</em> Brenchly <em>in the Western Parts of</em> Kent, <em>the Spire of the
Steeple which was of an extraordinary hight was overturn'd;
the particulars whereof you have in the following Letter, from
the Minister of the place.</em></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="salutation"><em>SIR</em>,</p>

<p class="noi">According to your request, and my promise, for the service of the
publick, I have here given you an Account of the Effects of the
late Tempestuous Winds in the Parish of <em>Brenchly</em>, in the County
of <em>Kent</em>, as freely and impartially as can be consistent with the
Damages sustained thereby, <em>viz.</em></p>

<p>A stately Steeple, whose Altitude exceeded almost, if not all, in
<em>Kent</em>, the height whereof, according to various Computations, it
never in my knowledge being exactly measured, did amount at
least to 10 Rods; some say 12, and others more; yet this strong
and noble Structure by the Rage of the Winds was levelled with
the Ground, and made the sport and pastime of Boys and Girls,
who to future Ages, tho' perhaps incredibly, yet can boast they
leaped over such a Steeple, the fall thereof beat down great part
of the Church and Porch, the damage of which to repair, as
before, will not amount to less than 800 or 1000 <em>l.</em> This is the
publick loss; neither does private and particular much less bemoan
their Condition, for some Houses, and some Barns, with other
Buildings, are quite demolished; tho' Blessed be God, not many
Lives or Limbs lost in the fall, and not one House, but what
suffered greatly by the Tempest. Neither were Neighbouring
Parishes much more favoured; but especially, a place called <em>Great
Peckham</em>, whose Steeple also, almost as high as ours, was then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>blown down, but not so much Damage to the Church, which God
preserve safe and sound for ever.</p>

<p class="noi"><em>As the above Letter mentions the fall of the Spire of</em> Great
Peckham, <em>we have omitted a particular Letter from the place.</em></p>

<p><em>In or near</em> Hawkhurst <em>in</em> Sussex, <em>a Waggon standing in a Field
loaden with Straw, and bound well down in order to be fetch't
away the next day, the Wind took the Waggon, drove it backward
several Rods, force't it through a very thick Hedge into
the Road, and the way being dirty, drove it with that force into
the Mud or Clay of the Road, that six Horses could not pull it
out.</em></p>

<p><em>The Collector of these Accounts cannot but enter the Remarks
he made, having occasion to Traverse the County of</em> Kent <em>about
a Month after the Storm; and besides, the general Desolation
which in every Village gave almost the same prospect; he
declares, that he reckoned 1107 dwelling Houses, Out-houses
and Barns blown quite down, whole Orchards of Fruit Trees
laid flat upon the Ground, and of all other sorts of Trees such a
quantity, that tho' he attempted to take an Account of them, he
found 'twas impossible, and was oblig'd to give it over.</em></p>

<p><em>From</em> Monmouth <em>we have a Letter, that among a vast variety
of Ruins, in their own Houses and Barns; one whereof fell with
a quantity of Sheep in it, of which seven were kill'd: The Lead
of the great Church, tho' on the side from the Wind, was roll'd
up like a roll of Cloth, and blown off from the Church.</em></p>

<p><em>I chose to note this, because the Letter says, it was upon the
North-side of the Church, and which seems to confirm what I
have observ'd before, of the Eddies of the Wind, the Operation
whereof has been very strange in several places, and more Violent
than the Storm it self.</em></p>

<p><em>At</em> Wallingford, <em>one</em> Robert Dowell, <em>and his Wife, being both
in Bed, the Chimney of the House fell in, demolish'd the House,
and the main Beam breaking fell upon the Bed, the Woman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>receiv'd but little Damage, but the Man had his Thigh broke by
the Beam, and lay in a dangerous Condition when the Letter
was wrote, which was the 18th of</em> January <em>after</em>.</p>

but honest Account.</em></p>

follows: Dr. <em>Towgood</em> had his Court Gate, with a piece of Wall
blown to the other side of the Road, and stands upright against
the Hedge, which was 12 Foot over, and it was as big as two
Horses could draw: A sheet of Lead which lay flat was carried
from Sir <em>William Drake</em>'s quite over a Wall into the Minister's
Court, near three-score Yards: There was a Tree which stood in
Mr. <em>John Whitty</em>'s Ground which broke in the middle, and the
top of it blew over the Hedge, and over a Wall, and over a top of
a House, and did not hurt the House: There was a Mow of Corn
that was blown off the Posts, and sate upright without hurt,
belonging to <em>William Oliver</em>, at an Estate of <em>Edward Seymour</em>'s,
called <em>Chappel Craft</em>: A Maiden Oke which stood in the <em>Quille</em>
more than a Man could fathom, was broke in the middle: Several
hundred of Apple-Trees, and other Trees blown down: Most
Houses damnify'd in the Tiles and Thatch, but no Houses blown
down, and no Person hurt nor killed; neither did the Church nor
Tower, nor the Trees in the Church-yard received much Damage:
Our loss in the Apple-Trees is the greatest; because we shall want
Liquor to make our Hearts merry; the Farmer's sate them up
again, but the Wind has blown them down since the Storm.</p></blockquote>

Five Chimneys falling down in a place called the Colledge, the
place where the Prebendaries Lodgings are, did no other damage
(prais'd be God) then beat down some part of the Houses along
with them; the loss which the Church and College of <em>Ely</em> sustain'd,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>being by computation near 2000 <em>l.</em> The Sufferers are the Reverend
the Dean and Chapter of the said Cathedral. The Wind Mills
belonging both to the Town and Country, felt a worse fate, being
blown or burnt down by the Violence of the Wind, or else disabled
to that degree, that they were wholy unable of answering the
design they were made for; three of the aforesaid Mills belonging
to one <em>Jeremiah Fouldsham</em> of <em>Ely</em>, a very Industrious Man of
mean Substance, were burnt and blown down, to the almost Ruin
and Impoverishment of the aforesaid Person, his particular loss
being upward of a 100 <em>l.</em> these are the most remarkable disasters
that befel this side of the Country. The Inhabitants both of the
Town of <em>Ely</em> and Country general, receiv'd some small damages
more or less in their Estates and Substance, <em>viz.</em> The Houses being
stript of the Tiling, Barns and Out-houses laid even with the
Ground, and several Stacks of Corn and Cocks of Hay being
likewise much damaged, the general loss being about 20000 <em>l.</em> the
escape of all Persons here from Death, being generally miraculous;
none as we can hear of being kill'd, tho' some were in more
imminent danger than others. This, Sir, is as true, and as faithful
an account as we are able to collect.</p>

Sackt it.</p>

<p><em>The following Letter from a small Town near</em> Helford <em>in</em>
Cornwall <em>is very Authentick, and may be depended on</em>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="salutation"><em>SIR</em>,</p>

<p class="noi">According to your Request, in a late Advertisement, in which you
desir'd an Impartial Account of what Accidents hapned by the
late Dreadful Storm, in order to make a true and just Collection
of the same, please to take the following Relation, <em>viz.</em> Between 8
and 9-a-Clock the Storm began, with the Wind at N.W. about
10-a-Clock it veer'd about from W. to S.W. and back to West
again, and between 11 and 12-a-Clock it blew in a most violent
and dreadful manner, that the Country hereabouts thought the
great day of Judgment was coming.</p>

<p>It continued thus blowing till 5-a-Clock and then began to
abate a little, but has done a Prodigious damage to almost all
sorts of People, for either their Houses are blown down, or their
Corn blown out of their tack-yards (some Furlongs distance)
from the same that the very fields look in a manner, as if they had
shak'd the Sheaves of Corn over them. Several Barns blown down,
and the Corn that was in the same carried clear away.</p>

<p>The Churches here abouts have suffered very much, the Roofs of
several are torn in pieces, and blown a considerable Distance off.</p>

<p>The small Quantity of Fruit-Trees we had in the Neighbourhood
about us are so dismember'd, and torn in pieces, that few
or none are left fit for bearing Fruit.</p>

<p>The large Timber Trees, as Elm, Oak, and the like, are generally
blown down, especially the largest and highest Trees suffered
most; for few Gentlemen that had Trees about their Houses have
any left; and it is generally observ'd here, that the Trees and
Houses that stood in Valleys, and most out of the Wind, have
suffered most. In short, the Damage has been so general, that
both Rich and Poor have suffered much.</p>

<p>In <em>Helford</em>, a small Haven, not far from hence, there was a Tin
Ship blown from her Anchors with only one Man, and two Boys
on Board, without Anchor, Cable or Boat, and was forc'd out of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>the said Haven about 12-a-Clock at Night; the next Morning by
8-a-Clock, the Ship miraculously Run in between two Rocks in
the <em>Isle of Wight</em>, where the Men and Goods were saved, but the
Ship lost: Such a Run, in so short a time, is almost Incredible, it
being near 80 Leagues in 8 hours time, I believe it to be very true,
for the Master of the said Ship I know very well, and some that
were concern'd in her Lading, which was Tin, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="center"><em>Thus far our Letters</em>.</p>

<p class="noi">It has been impossible to give an exact relation in the matter of
publick Damage, either as to the particulars of what is remarkeable,
or an Estimate of the general loss.</p>

<p>The Abstract here given, as near as we could order it, is
so well taken, that we have, <em>generally speaking</em>, something
remarkable from every quarter of the Kingdom, to the South of
the <em>Trent</em>.</p>

<p>It has been observ'd, that tho' it blew a great Storm farther
Northward, yet nothing so furious as this way. At <em>Hull</em>, indeed,
as the Relation Expresses, it was violent, but even that violence
was moderate, compar'd to the Stupendious fury with which all
the Southern part of the Nation was Attack'd.</p>

<p>When the Reader finds an Account here from <em>Milford-haven</em>
in <em>Wales</em>, and from <em>Helford</em> in <em>Cornwall</em> West, from <em>Yarmouth</em>
and <em>Deal</em> in the East, from <em>Portsmouth</em> in the South, and <em>Hull</em>
in the North, I am not to imagine him so weak as to suppose all
the vast Interval had not the same, or proportion'd suffering,
when you find one Letter from a Town, and two from a County,
it is not to be supposed that was the whole damage in that
County, but, on the contrary, that every Town in the County
suffered the same thing in proportion; and it would have been
endless to the Collector, and tiresom to the Reader, to have
Enumerated all the Individuals of every County; 'twould be
endless to tell the the Desolation in the Parks, Groves, and fine
Walks of the Gentry, the general havock in the Orchards and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>Gardens among the Fruit Trees, especially in the Counties of
<em>Devon</em>, <em>Somerset</em>, <em>Hereford</em>, <em>Gloucester</em> and <em>Worcester</em>, where
the making great quantities of Cyder and Perry, is the reason of
numerous and large Orchards, among which, for several Miles
together, there would be very few Trees left.</p>

<p>In <em>Kent</em> the Editor of this Book has seen several great
Orchards, the Trees lying flat on the Ground, and perhaps one
Tree standing in a place by it self, as a House might shelter it,
perhaps none at all.</p>

<p>So many Trees were every where blown cross the Road, that
till the People were call'd to saw them off, and remove them,
the ways were not passable.</p>

<p>Stacks of Corn and Hay were in all places either blown down,
or so torn, that they receiv'd great damage, and in this Article
'tis very observable, those which were only blown down receiv'd
the least Injury; when the main body of a Stack of Hay stood
safe, the top being loosen'd by the Violence of the Wind, the
Hay was driven up into the Air, and flew about like Feathers;
that it was entirely lost and hung about in the Neighbouring
Trees, and spread on the Ground for a great distance and so
perfectly seperated, that there was no gathering it together.</p>

<p>Barly and Oats suffered the same casualty, only that the
weight of the Corn settled it sooner to the Ground than the
Hay.</p>

<p>As to the Stacks of Wheat, the Accounts are very strange;
from many places we have Letters, and some so incredible, that
we dare not venture on the Readers faith to transmit them, least
they should shock their belief in those very strange Relations
already set down, and better Attested, as of a great Stack of
Corn taken from the Hovel on which it stood, and without
Dislocating the Sheaves, set upon another Hovel, from whence
the Wind had just before remov'd another Stack of equal Dimensions;
of a Stack of Wheat taken up with the Wind, and set
down whole 16 Rod off, and the like. But as we have other
Relations equally strange, their Truth considered, we refer the
Reader to them, and assure the World we have several Accounts
of Stacks of Wheat taken clear off from the Frame or Steddal,
and set down whole, abundance more over-set, and thrown off
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>from their standings, and others quite dispers'd, and in a great
measure destroy'd.</p>

<p>'Tis true, Corn was exceeding cheap all the Winter after, but
they who bring that as a reason to prove there was no great
quantity destroy'd, are oblig'd to bear with me in telling them
they are mistaken, for the true reason was as follows,</p>

<p>The Stacks of Corn in some Counties, the West chiefly, where
the People generally lay up their Corn in Stacks, being so damnify'd
as above, and the Barns in all parts being Universally
uncovered, and a vast number of them overturn'd, and blown
down, the Country People were under a necessity of Threshing
out their Corn with all possible speed, least if a Rain had
follow'd, as at that time of Year was not unlikely, it might ha'
been all spoil'd.</p>

<p>And it was a special Providence to those People also, as well
as to us in <em>London</em>; that it did not Rain, at least to any quantity,
for near three Weeks after the Storm.</p>

<p>Besides this, the Country People were obliged to thresh out
their Corn for the sake of the Straw, which they wanted to
repair the Thatch, and covering of their Barns, in order to secure
the rest.</p>

<p>All these Circumstances forc'd the Corn to Market in unusual
quantities, and that by Consequence made it Cheaper than
ordinary, and not the exceeding quantity then in Store.</p>

<p>The Seats of the Gentlemen in all places had an extraordinary
share in the Damage; their Parks were in many places perfectly
dismantled, the Trees before their Doors levelled, their Garden
Walls blown down, and I could give a List, I believe, of a
thousand Seats in <em>England</em>, within the compass of our Collected
Papers, who had from 5 to 20 Stacks of Chimnies blown down,
some more, some less, according to the several Dimentions of
the Houses.</p>

<p>I am not obliging the Reader to comply with the Calculations
here following, and it would have took up too much room in
this small Tract to name particulars; but according to the best
estimate I have been able to make from the general Accounts
sent up by Persons forward to have this matter recorded, the
following particulars are rather under than over the real Truth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span></p>

<p>25 Parks in the several Counties, who have above 1000 Trees
in each Park, blown down.</p>

<p><em>New Forest</em> in <em>Hampshire</em> above 4000, and some of prodigious
Bigness; above 450 Parks and Groves, who have from
200 large Trees to 1000 blown down in them.</p>

<p>Above 100 Churches covered with Lead, the Lead roll'd up,
the Churches uncover'd; and on some of them, the Lead in
prodigious Quantities blown to incredible Distances from the
Church.</p>

<p>Above 400 Wind-mils overset, and broken to pieces; or the
Sails so blown round, that the Timbers and Wheels have heat
and set the rest on Fire, and so burnt them down, as particularly
several were in the Isle of <em>Ely</em>.</p>

<p>Seven Steeples quite blown down, besides abundance of
Pinacles and Battlements from those which stood; and the
Churches where it happened most of them Demolish'd, or terribly
Shattered.</p>

<p>Above 800 dwelling Houses blown down, in most of which
the Inhabitants received some Bruise or Wounds, and many lost
their Lives.</p>

<p>We have reckoned, including the City of <em>London</em>, about 123
People kill'd; besides such as we have had no account of; the
Number of People drowned are not easily Guest; but by all the
Calculations I have made and seen made, we are within compass,
if we reckon 8000 Men lost, including what were lost on the
Coast of <em>Holland</em>, what in Ships blown away, and never heard
of, and what were drowned in the Flood of the <em>Severn</em>, and in
the River of <em>Thames</em>.</p>

<p>What the Loss, how many poor Families ruin'd, is not to be
Estimated, the Fire of <em>London</em> was an exceeding Loss, and
was by some reckon'd at four Millions sterling; which, tho'
it was a great Loss, and happened upon the spot, where vast
Quantities of Goods being expos'd to the fury of the Flames,
were destroy'd in a hurry, and 14000 dwelling Houses entirely
consum'd.</p>

<p>Yet on the other Hand, that Desolation was confin'd to a
small Space, the loss fell on the wealthiest part of the People;
but this loss is Universal, and its extent general, not a House,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>not a Family that had any thing to lose, but have lost something
by this Storm, the Sea, the Land, the Houses, the Churches,
the Corn, the Trees, the Rivers, all have felt the fury of the
Winds.</p>

<p>I cannot therefore think I speak too large, if I say, I am of the
Opinion, that the Damage done by this Tempest far exceeded
the Fire of <em>London</em>.</p>

<p>They tell us the Damages done by the Tide, on the Banks of
the <em>Severn</em>, amounts to above 200000 pounds, 15000 Sheep
drown'd in one Level, Multitudes of Cattle on all the sides, and
the covering the Lands with Salt Water is a Damage cannot well
be Estimated: The High Tide at <em>Bristol</em> spoil'd or damnify'd
1500 Hogsheds of Sugars and Tobaccoes, besides great quantities
of other Goods.</p>

<p>'Tis impossible to describe the general Calamity, and the most
we can do is, to lead our Reader to supply by his Immagination
what we omit; and to believe, that as the Head of the particulars
is thus collected, an infinite Variety at the same time happened
in every place, which cannot be expected to be found in this
Relation.</p>

<p>There are some additional Remarks to be made as to this
Tempests, which I cannot think improper to come in here: As,</p>

<p>1. That in some Parts of <em>England</em> it was join'd with terrible
Lightnings and Flashings of Fire, and in other places none at all;
as to Thunder the Noise the Wind made, was so Terrible, and
so Unusual, that I will not say, People might not mistake it for
Thunder; but I have not met with any, who will be positive that
they heard it Thunder.</p>

<p>2. Others, as in many Letters we have received to that purpose
insist upon it, that they felt an Earthquake; and this I am
doubtful of for several Reasons.</p>

<p>1st. We find few People either in City or Country ventur'd
out of their Houses, or at least till they were forced out, and I
cannot find any Voucher to this opinion of an Earthquake, from
those whose Feet stood upon the <em>Terra Firma</em>, felt it move, and
will affirm it to be so.</p>

<p>2d. As to all those People who were in Houses, I cannot allow
them to be competent Judges, for as no House was so strong as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>not to move and shake with the force of the Wind, so it must be
impossible for them to distinguish whither that motion came
from above or below: As to those in Ships, they will not pretend
to be competent Judges in this case, and I think the People within
doors as improper to decide, for what might not that motion
they felt in their Houses, from the Wind do, that an Earthquake
could do. We found it rockt the strongest Buildings, and in
several places made the Bells in the Steeples strike, loosen'd the
Foundations of the Houses, and in some below them quite
down, but still if it had been an Earthquake, it must have been
felt in every house, and every place; and whereas in those Streets
of <em>London</em>, where the Houses stand thick and well Built, they
could not be so shaken with the Wind as in opener places;
yet there the other would have equally been felt, and better
distinguisht; and this particularly by the Watch, who stood on
the Ground, under shelter of publick Buildings, as in St. <em>Paul</em>'s
Church, the Exchange Gates, the Gates of the City, and such
like; wherefore, as I am not for handing to Posterity any matter
of Fact upon ill Evidence, so I cannot transmit what has its
Foundation only in the Amazements of the People.</p>

<p>'Tis true, that there was an Earthquake felt in the <em>North East
parts of the Kingdoms</em>, about a Month afterwards, of which
several Letters here inserted make mention, and one very particularly
from <em>Hull</em>; but that there was any such thing as an
Earthquake during the Storm, I cannot agree.</p>

<p>Another remarkable thing I have observ'd, and have several
Letters to show of the Water which fell in the Storm, being
brackish, and at <em>Cranbrook</em> in <em>Kent</em>, which is at least 16 Miles
from the Sea, and above 25 from any Part of the Sea to windward,
from whence the Wind could bring any moisture, <em>for it
could not be suppos'd to fly against the Wind</em>; the Grass was so
salt, the Cattel would not eat for several Days, from whence the
ignorant People suggested another Miracle, <em>viz.</em> that it rain'd
salt Water.</p>

<p>The answer to this, I leave to two Letters printed in the
<em>Philosophical Transactions</em>; as follows,</p>

<p class="noi subtitle"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>

<p class="salutation"><em>SIR</em>,</p>

<p class="noi">I have just now, since my writing, receiv'd an account from a
Clergy-man, an Intelligent Person at <em>Lewes</em> in <em>Sussex</em>, not only
that the Storm made great desolations thereabouts, but also an
odd Phænomenon occasioned by it, <em>viz.</em> 'That a Physician travelling
soon after the Storm to <em>Tisehyrst</em>, about 20 Miles from <em>Lewes</em>,
and as far from the Sea, as he rode he pluckt some tops of Hedges,
and chawing them found them Salt. Some Ladies of <em>Lewes</em> hearing
this, tasted some Grapes that were still on the Vines, and they
also had the same relish. The Grass on the Downs in his Parish
was so salt, that the Sheep in the Morning would not feed till
hunger compelled them, and afterwards drank like Fishes, as the
Shepherds report. This he attributeth to Saline Particles driven
from the Sea.&mdash;He heareth also, that People about <em>Portsmouth</em>
were much annoyed with sulphurous Fumes, complaining they
were most suffocated therewith'.</p></blockquote>

Water may be so dash'd and beaten against the Banks and Dikes

<p>Upon the 8th of <em>December</em>, 1703. N.S. We had a dreadful

the lower Windows of my House, which are made of very fine

hour they were deprived of most of their transparency, and,
forasmuch as these Particles of Water were not quite exhaled, I
concluded that it must be Sea-water, which the said Storm had
not only dasht against our Windows, but spread also over the
whole Country.</p>

<p>That I might be satisfied herein, I blow'd two small Glasses,
such as I thought most proper to make my Observations with,
concerning the Particles of Water that adhered to my Windows.</p>

<p>Pressing these Glasses gently against my Windows, that were
covered with the suppos'd Particles of Sea-water, my Glasses were
tinged with a few of the said Particles.</p>

<p>These Glasses, with the Water I had thus collected on them, I
placed at about half a Foot distance from the Candle, I view'd
them by my Microscope, reck'ning, that by the warmth of the
Candle, and my Face together, the Particles of the said Water
would be put into such a motion, that they would exhale for the
most part, and the Salts that were in 'em would be expos'd naked
to the sight, and so it happened; for in a little time a great many
Salt Particles did, as it were, come out of the Water, having the
Figure of our common Salt, but very small, because the Water
was little, from whence those small Particles proceeded; and
where the Water had lain very thin upon the Glass, there were
indeed a great number of Salt Particles, but so exceeding fine, that
they almost escaped the Sight through a very good Microscope.</p>

<p>From whence I concluded, that these Glass windows could not
be brought to their former Lustre, but by washing them with a
great deal of Water; for if the Air were very clear, and the Weather
dry, the watry Particles would soon exhale, but the Salts would
cleave fast to the Glass, which said Salts would be again dissolv'd
in moist Weather, and sit like a Dew or Mist upon the Windows.</p>

<p>And accordingly my People found it when they came to wash
the afore-mentioned lower Windows of my House: but as to the
upper Windows, where the Rain had beat against them, there was
little or no Salt to be found sticking upon that Glass.</p>

<p>Now, if we consider, what a quantity of Sea-water is spread all
over the Country by such a terrible Storm, and consequently, how
greatly impregnated the Air is with the same; we ought not to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>wonder, that such a quantity of Water, being moved with so great
a force, should do so much mischief to Chimneys, tops of Houses,
<em>&amp;c.</em> not to mention the Damages at Sea.</p>

<p>During the said Storm, and about 8-a-Clock in the Morning, I
cast my Eye upon my Barometer, and observ'd, that I had never
seen the Quick-silver so low; but half an hour after the Quick-silver
began to rise, tho' the Storm was not at all abated, at least
to any appearance; from whence I concluded, and said it to those
that were about me, that the Storm would not last long; and so it
happened.</p>

<p>There are some that affirm, that the scattering of this Salt-water
by the Storm will do a great deal of harm to the Fruits of the
Earth; but for my part I am of a quite different Opinion, for I
believe that a little Salt spread over the surface of the Earth,
especially where it is heavy Clay-ground, does render it exceeding
Fruitful; and so it would be, if the Sand out of the Sea were made
use of to the same purpose.</p></blockquote>

<p class="noi p2">These Letters are too well, and too judiciously Written to need
any comment of mine; 'tis plain, the watry Particles taken up
from the Sprye of the Sea into the Air, might by the impetuosity
of the Winds be carried a great way, and if it had been much
farther, it would have been no Miracle in my account; and this
is the reason, why I have not related these Things, among the
extraordinary Articles of the Storm.</p>

<p>That the Air was full of Meteors, and fiery Vapours, and that
the extraordinary Motion occasion'd the firing more of them
than usual, a small stock of Philosophy will make very rational;
and of these we have various Accounts, more in some places
than in others, and I am apt to believe these were the Lightnings
we have been told of; for I am of Opinion, that there was really
no Lightning, such as we call so in the common Acceptation
of it; for the Clouds that flew with so much Violence through
the Air, were not, as to my Observation, such as usually are
fraighted with Thunder and Lightning, the Hurries nature was
then in, do not consist with the System of Thunder, which is Air
pent in between the Clouds; and as for the Clouds that were
seen here flying in the Air, they were by the fury of the Winds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>so seperated, and in such small Bodies, that there was no
room for a Collection suitable, and necessary to the Case we
speak of.</p>

<p>These Cautions I thought necessary to set down here, for the
satisfaction of the Curious; and as they are only my Opinions, I
submit them to the judgment of the Reader.</p>

<h2><em>Of the Damages on the Water</em></h2>

<p class="noi">As this might consist of several Parts, I was inclin'd to have
divided it into Sections or Chapters, relating particularly to the
publick Loss, and the private; to the Merchant, or the Navy, to
Floods by the Tides, to the River Damage, and that of the Sea;
but for brevity, I shall confine it to the following particulars.</p>

<ul>
<li>First, <em>The Damage to Trade</em>.</li>
<li>Secondly, <em>The Damage to the Royal Navy</em>.</li>
<li>Thirdly, <em>The Damage by High Tides</em>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>First, <em>of the Damage to Trade</em>.</h3>

<p class="noi">I might call it a Damage to Trade, that this Season was both for
some time before and after the Tempest, so exceeding, and so
continually Stormy, that the Seas were in a manner Unnavigable
and Negoce, at a kind of a general Stop, and when the Storm
was over, and the Weather began to be tolerable; almost all the
Shipping in <em>England</em> was more or less out of Repair, for there
was very little Shipping in the Nation, but what had receiv'd
some Damage or other.</p>

<p>It is impossible, but a Nation so full of Shipping as this, must
be exceeding Sufferers in such a general Disaster, and who ever
considers the Violence of this Storm by its other dreadful Effects
will rather wonder, and be thankful that we receiv'd no farther
Damage, than we shall be able to give an Account of by Sea.</p>

<p>I have already observ'd what Fleets were in the several Ports
of this Nation, and from whence they came: As to Ships lost of
whom we have no other Account than that they were never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>heard of. I am not able to give any Perticulars, other than that
about three and forty Sail of all Sorts are reckon'd to have
perished in that manner. I mean of such Ships as were at Sea,
when the Storm began, and had no Shelter or Port to make for
their Safety: Of these, some were of the <em>Russia</em> Fleet, of whom
we had an Account of 20 Sail lost the Week before the great
Storm, but most of them reach'd the Ports of <em>Newcastle</em>,
<em>Humber</em> and <em>Yarmouth</em>, and some of the Men suffered in the
general Distress afterwards.</p>

<p>But to proceed to the most general Disasters, by the same
Method, as in the former Articles of Damages by Land. Several
Persons having given themselves the Trouble to further this
Design with Authentick Particulars from the respective Ports. I
conceive we cannot give the World a clearer and more Satisfactory
Relation than from their own Words.</p>

<p class="noi p2"><em>The first Account, and plac'd so, because 'tis very Authentick
and Particular, and the furthest Port</em> Westward, <em>and therefore
proper to begin our Relation, is from on Board her Majesty's
Ship the</em> Dolphin <em>in</em> Milford Haven, <em>and sent to us by Capt</em>.
Soanes, <em>the Commodore of a Squadron of Men of War then in
that Harbour, to whom the Public is very much oblig'd for the
Relation, and which we thought our selves bound there to
acknowledge. The Account is as follows</em>,</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="salutation"><em>SIR</em>,</p>

<p class="noi">Reading the Advertisement in the <em>Gazette</em>, of your intending to
Print the many sad Accidents in the late dreadful Storm, induced
me to let you know what this place felt, tho a very good Harbour.
Her Majesty's Ships the <em>Cumberland</em>, <em>Coventry</em>, <em>Loo</em>, <em>Hastings</em>
and <em>Hector</em>, being under my Command, with the <em>Rye</em> a Cruizer
on this Station, and under our Convoy about 130 Merchant Ships
bound about Land; the 26th of <em>November</em> at one in the Afternoon
the Wind came at S. by E. a hard Gale, between which and N.W.
by W. it came to a dreadful Storm, at three the next Morning was
the Violentest of the Weather, when the <em>Cumberland</em> broak her
Sheet Anchor, the Ship driving near <em>this</em>, and the <em>Rye</em>, both
narrowly escap'd carrying away; she drove very near the Rocks,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>having but one Anchor left, but in a little time they slung a
Gun, with the broken Anchor fast to it, which they let go, and
wonderfully preserv'd the Ship from the Shoar. Guns firing from
one Ship or other all the Night for help, tho' 'twas impossible to
assist each other, the Sea was so high, and the Darkness of the
Night such, that we could not see where any one was, but by the
Flashes of the Guns; when day light appear'd, it was a dismal
sight to behold the Ships driving up and down one foul of another,
without Masts, some sunk, and others upon the Rocks, the Wind
blowing so hard, with Thunder, Lightning and Rain, that on the
Deck a Man could not stand without holding. Some drove from
<em>Dale</em>, where they were shelter'd under the Land, and split in
pieces, the Men all drowned; two others drove out of a Creek,
one on the Shoar so high up was saved, the other on the Rocks in
another Creek, and Bulg'd; an <em>Irish</em> Ship that lay with a Rock
thro' her, was lifted by the Sea clear away to the other side of the
Creek on a safe place; one Ship forc'd 10 Miles up the River
before she could be stop'd, and several strangely blown into holes,
and on Banks; a Ketch of <em>Pembroke</em> was drove on the Rocks, the
two Men and a Boy in her had no Boat to save their Lives; but in
this great distress a Boat which broke from another Ship drove
by them, without any in her, the two Men leap into her, and were
sav'd, but the Boy drown'd; a Prize at <em>Pembroke</em> was lifted on the
Bridge, whereon is a Mill, which the Water blew up, but the
Vessel got off again; another Vessel carried almost into the Gateway
which leads to the Bridge, and is a Road, the Tide flowing
several Foot above its common Course. The Storm continu'd till
the 27th about 3 in the Afternoon; that by Computation nigh 30
Merchant Ships and Vessels without Masts are lost, and what
Men are lost is not known; 3 Ships are missing, that we suppose
Men and all lost. None of her Majesty's Ships came to any harm;
but the <em>Cumberland</em> breaking her Anchor in a Storm which
happen'd the 18th at Night, lost another, which renders her
uncapable of proceeding with us till supply'd. I saw several Trees
and Houses which are blown down.</p>

<em>The next Account we have from the Reverend Mr.</em> Tho. Chest,
<em>Minister of</em> Chepstow, <em>whose Ingenious account being given
in his own Words, gives the best Acknowledgement for his
forwarding and approving this design.</em></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="salutation"><em>SIR</em>,</p>

<p class="noi">Upon the Evening of <em>Friday, Nov.</em> 26. 1703, the Wind was very
high; but about midnight it broke out with a more than wonted
Violence, and so continued till near break of day. It ended a N.W.
Wind, tho' about 3 in the Morning it was at S.W. The loudest
cracks I observed of it, were somewhat before 4 of the Clock; we
had here the common Calamity of Houses shatter'd and Trees
thrown down.</p>

<p>But the Wind throwing the Tyde very strongly into the <em>Severn</em>,
and so into the <em>Wye</em>, on which <em>Chepstow</em> is situated. And the Fresh
in <em>Wye</em> meeting with a Rampant Tyde, overflowed the lower part
of our Town. It came into several Houses about 4 foot high, rather
more; the greatest damage sustained in Houses, was by the makers
of Salt, perhaps their loss might amount to near 200 <em>l.</em></p>

<p>But the Bridge was a strange sight; it stands partly in <em>Monmouthshire</em>,
and partly in <em>Gloucestershire</em>, and is built mostly of
Wood, with a Stone Peer in the midst, the Center of which divides
the two Counties; there are also Stone Platforms in the bottom of
the River to bear the Wood-work. I doubt not but those Stone
Platforms were covered then by the great Fresh that came down
the River. But over these there are Wooden Standards fram'd into
Peers 42 Foot high; besides Groundsils, Cap-heads, Sleepers,
Planks, and (on each side of the Bridge) Rails which may make
about 6 foot more, the Tyde came over them all: The length of
the Wooden part of the Bridge in <em>Monmouthshire</em> is 60 yards
exactly, and thereabout in <em>Gloucestershire</em>; the <em>Gloucestershire</em>
side suffered but little, but in <em>Monmouthshire</em> side the Planks
were most of them carried away, the Sleepers (about a Tun by
measure each) were many of them carried away, and several
removed, and 'tis not doubted but the great Wooden Peers would
have gone too; but it was so, that the outward Sleepers on each
side the Bridge were Pinn'd or Bolted to the Cap-heads, and so
kept them in their places.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>

All the level Land on the South part of <em>Monmouthshire</em>, called
the <em>Moors</em>, was overflow'd; it is a tract of Land about 20 miles
long, all Level, save 2 little points of High-land, or 3; the Breadth
of it is not all of one size, the broadest part is about 2 miles and
½. This Tyde came 5 Tydes before the top of the Spring, according
to the usual run, which surprized the People very much. Many of
their Cattle got to shore, and some dy'd after they were landed.
It is thought by a <em>Moderate Computation</em>, they might lose in Hay
and Cattle between 3 and 4000 <em>l.</em> I cannot hear of any Person
drowned, save only one Servant Man, that ventur'd in quest of
his Master's Cattle. The People were carried off, some by Boats,
some otherways, the days following; the last that came off (that I
can hear of) were on <em>Tuesday</em> Evening, to be sure they were
uneasy and astonished in that Interval. There are various reports
about the height of this Tyde in the <em>Moors</em>, comparing it with
that in <em>Jan.</em> 1606. But the account that seems likeliest to me, is,
that the former Tyde ran somewhat higher than this. 'Tis thought
most of their Land will be worth but little these 2 or 3 years,
and 'tis known, that the repairing the Sea Walls will be very
chargeable.</p>

<p><em>Gloucestershire</em> too, that borders upon <em>Severne</em> hath suffered
deeply on the Forrest of <em>Deane</em> side, but nothing in comparison
of the other shore, from about <em>Harlingham</em> down to the mouth
of <em>Bristol</em> River <em>Avon</em>, particularly from <em>Aust Cliffe</em> to the Rivers
Mouth (about 8 miles) all that Flat, called the <em>Marsh</em> was
drowned. They lost many Sheep and Cattle. About 70 Seamen
were drown'd out of the <em>Canterbury</em> Storeship, and other Ships
that were Stranded or Wreck'd. The <em>Arundel</em> Man of War, <em>Suffolk</em>
and <em>Canterbury</em> Storeships, a <em>French</em> Prize, and a <em>Dane</em>, were
driven ashore and damnified; but the <em>Arundel</em> and the <em>Danish</em>
Ship are got off, the rest remain on Ground. The <em>Richard and
John</em> of about 500 Tun, newly come into <em>King-road</em> from <em>Virginia</em>,
was Staved. The <em>Shoram</em> rode it out in <em>King-road</em>; but I suppose
you may have a perfecter account of these things from <em>Bristol</em>.
But one thing yet is to be remembred, one <em>Nelms</em> of that Country,
as I hear his Name, was carried away with his Wife and 4 Children,
and House and all, and were all lost, save only one Girl, who
caught hold of a Bough, and was preserved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>

There was another unfortunate Accident yet in these parts, one
Mr. <em>Churchman</em>, that keeps the Inns at <em>Betesley</em>, a passage over
the <em>Severn</em>, and had a share in the passing Boats, seeing a single
Man tossed in a Wood-buss off in the River, prevailed with some
belonging to the Customs, to carry himself and one of his Sons,
and 2 Servants aboard the Boat, which they did, and the Officers
desired Mr. <em>Churchman</em> to take out the Man, and come ashore
with them in their Pinnace. But he, willing to save the Boat as
well as the Man, tarried aboard, and sometime after hoisting Sail,
the Boat overset, and they were all drowned, <em>viz.</em> the Man in
the Boat, Mr. <em>Churchman</em>, his Son and 2 Servants, and much
lamented, especially Mr. <em>Churchman</em>, and his Son, who were
Persons very useful in their Neighbourhood. This happened on
<em>Saturday</em> about 11 of the Clock.</p>

<p class="noi">Observing your desire (lately signify'd in the <em>Gazette</em>) to be further
inform'd concerning the Effects of the late dreadful Tempest, in
order to make a Collection thereof. I have presum'd to present
you with the following particulars concerning <em>Bristol</em>, and the
parts near Adjacent, being an Eye-witness of the same, or the
Majority of it. On <em>Saturday</em> the 27th of <em>Novemb.</em> last, between
the hours of one and two in the Morning, arose a most prodigious
Storm of Wind, which continued with very little intermission for
the space of 6 hours, in which time it very much shattered the
Buildings, both publick and private, by uncovering the Houses,
throwing down the Chimneys, breaking the Glass Windows,
overthrowing the Pinnacles and Battlements of the Churches, and
blowing off the Leads: The Churches in particular felt the fury of
the Storm. St. <em>Stephen</em>'s Tower had three Pinnacles blown off,
which beat down the greatest part of the Church. The Cathedral
is likewise very much defac'd, two of its Windows, and several
Battlements being blown away; and, indeed, most Churches in
the City felt its force more or less; it also blew down abundance of
great Trees in the Marsh, <em>College-Green</em>, St. <em>James</em>'s Church-yard,
and other places in the City. And in the Country it blew down
and scattered abundance of Hay and Corn Mows, besides almost
Levelling many Orchards and Groves of stout Trees. But the
greatest damage done to the City was, the violent over-flowing of
the Tide, occasion'd by the force of the Wind, which flowed
an extraordinary height, and did abundance of damage to the
Merchants Cellers. It broke in with great fury over the Marsh
Country, forcing down the Banks or Sea Walls, drowning abundance
of Sheep, and other Cattle, washing some houses clear
away, and breaking down part of others, in which many Persons
lost their Lives. It likewise drove most of the Ships in <em>Kingroad</em> a
considerable way upon the Land, some being much shatter'd, and
one large Vessel broke all in pieces, and near all the Men lost,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>besides several lost out of other Vessels. To conclude, the Damage
sustein'd by this City alone in Merchandise, Houses, &amp;c. is Computed
to an Hundred Thousand Pounds, besides the great Loss in
the Country, of Cattel, Corn, &amp;c. which has utterly ruined many
Farmers, whose substance consisted in their Stock aforesaid. So
having given you the most material Circumstances, and fatal
Effects of this great Tempest in these Parts. I conclude</p>

Account from, as we suppose, the Minister of the place, tho'
unknown to the Collector of this Work.</em></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="salutation"><em>SIR</em>,</p>

<p class="noi">The Parish of <em>Huntspill</em> hath receiv'd great Damage by the late
Inundation of the Salt Water, particularly the West part thereof
suffered most: For on the 27th Day of <em>November</em> last, about four
of the Clock in the Morning, a mighty Southwest Wind blew so
strong, as (in a little time) strangely tore our Sea Walls; insomuch,
that a considerable part of the said Walls were laid smooth, after
which the Sea coming in with great Violence, drove in five Vessels
belonging to <em>Bridgewater Key</em> out of the Channel, upon a Wharf
in our Parish, which lay some distance off from the Channel, and
there they were all grounded; it is said, that the Seamen there
fathom'd the depth and found it about nine Foot, which is taken
notice to be four Foot above our Walls when standing; the Salt
Water soon overflow'd all the West end of the Parish, forcing
many of the Inhabitants from their Dwellings, and to shift for
their Lives: The Water threw down several Houses, and in one an
antient Woman was drown'd, being about fourscore Years old:
Some Families shelter'd themselves in the Church, and there staid
till the Waters were abated: Three Window Leaves of the Tower
were blown down, and the Ruff-cast scal'd off in many places:
Much of the Lead of the Church was damnify'd; the Windows of
the Church and Chancel much broken, and the Chancel a great
part of it untiled: The Parsonage House, Barn and Walls received
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>great Damage; as also, did some of the Neighbours in their
Houses: At the West end of the Parsonage House stood a very
large Elm, which was four Yards a quarter and half a quarter in
the Circumference, it was broken off near the Ground by the
Wind, without forcing any one of the Moars above the Surface,
but remain'd as they were before: The Inhabitants (many of them)
have receiv'd great Losses in their Sheep, and their other Cattle;
in their Corn and Hay there is great spoil made. This is what
Information I can give of the Damage this Parish hath sustain'd
by the late dreadful Tempest.</p>

following Accounts are to be depended upon.</em></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="salutation"><em>SIR</em>,</p>

<p class="noi">I received yours, and in answer to it these are to acquaint you,
that all the Ships in our Harbour except two (which were 23 or
24 in Number, besides Fishing Boats) were, through the Violence
of the Storm, and the mooring Posts giving way, drove from their
Anchors, one of them was stav'd to pieces, nine drove Ashoar;
but 'tis hoped will be all got off again, though some of them are
very much damnified: Several of the Fishing Boats likewise, with
their Nets, and other Necessaries were destroy'd. Three Seamen
were drowned in the Storm, and one Man was squeez'd to Death
last <em>Wednesday</em>, by one of the Ships that was forc'd Ashoar,
suddenly coming upon him, as they were digging round her,
endeavouring to get her off.</p>

<p>Our Peer also was somewhat damaged, and 'tis thought, if the
Storm had continued till another Tide, it would have been quite
washed away, even level to the Ground; which if so, would
infallibly have ruined our Harbour: Our Church likewise was
almost all untiled, the neighbouring Churches also received much
Damage: The Houses of our Town, and all the Country round
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>about, were most of them damaged; some (as I am credibly
informed) blown down, and several in a great Measure uncovered:
Trees also of a very great Bigness were broken off in the middle,
and vast Numbers blown down; one Gentleman, as he told me
himself, having 2500 Trees blown down: I wish you good Success
in these your Undertakings, and I pray God that this late great
Calamity which was sent upon us as a punishment for our Sins,
may be a warning to the whole Nation in general, and engage
every one of us to a hearty and sincere Repentance; otherwise,

<p class="noi">I receiv'd yours and accordingly have made an enquiry in our
Neighbourhood what damage might be done in the late Storm,
thro Mercy we escap'd indifferently, but you will find underwritten
as much as I can learn to be certainly true.</p>

<p>The Storm began here about 12 at Night, but the most violent
part of it was about 4 the next Morning, about which time the
greatest part of the Houses in the Town were uncovered more or
less, and one House clearly blown down; the damage sustain'd to
the Houses is modestly computed at 200 <em>l.</em> the South Isle of the
Church was wholly uncovered, and considerable damage done to
the other Isles, and 4 large Stones weighing about One Hundred
and Fifty or Two Hundred Pound each, was blown down from
the end of the Church, three of the four Iron Spears, that stood
with Vanes on the corners of the Tower, were broke short off in
the middle, and the Vanes not to be found, and the Tail of the
Weather Cock, which stood in the middle of the Tower was
blown off, and found in a Court near 400 yards distant from the
Tower. In <em>Cline</em> Wood belonging to the Duke of <em>Beaufort</em> near
this Town, there is about 100 large Trees blown down; as also in
a Wood on our River belonging to Mr. <em>Thomas Mansell</em> of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span><em>Brittonferry</em> about 80 large Oakes. The Tydes did not much
damage, but two Ships were blown off our Bar, and by Providence
one came aground on the Salt House point near our Harbour,
else the Ship and Men had perished; the other came on shore, but
was saved. I hear further, that there are several Stacks of Corn
over-turn'd by the violence of the Wind, in the Parishes of <em>Roysily</em>
and <em>Largenny</em> in <em>Gower</em>; most of the Thatcht Houses in this
Neighbourhood was uncovered. Sir, this you may rely on to be

I had almost forgotten, and I think is very remarkable, that there
was found on the Hedges and Twigs of Trees, knobs of Salt

<p class="noi">You desire to know what effect the late dreadful Storm of Wind
had upon this Town; in answer to your desire, take the following
Account. This Town consists of at least 600 Houses, besides
two great Churches, some Publick Buildings, and many Shops
standing upon the Beach near the Sea, and yet by the special
Blessing and Providence of God, the whole Town suffered not
above 30 or 40 <em>l.</em> damage in their Houses, Churches, Publick
Building and Shops, and neither Man, Woman or Child suffered
the least hurt by the said Terrible Storm. The Town stands upon
the Sea shore, but God be thanked the Sea did us no damage; and
the Tydes were not so great as we have seen upon far less Storms.
The Wind was exceeding Boisterous, which might drive the Froth
and Sea moisture six or seven miles up the Country, for at that
distances from the Sea, the Leaves of the Trees and Bushes, were
as Salt as if they had been dipped in the Sea, which can be imputed
to nothing else, but the Violent Winds carrying the Froth and
Moisture so far. I believe it may be esteemed almost Miraculous
that our Town escaped so well in the late terrible Storm, and
therefore I have given you this Account. I am</p>

<em>Restoration</em>, a third Rate, all sunk and drowned: These Ships
were all close by us which I saw; these Ships fired their Guns all
Night and Day long, poor Souls, for help, but the Storm being so
fierce and raging, could have none to save them: The Ship call'd
the <em>Shrewsberry</em> that we are in, broke two Anchors, and did run
mighty fierce backwards, within 60 or 80 Yards of the Sands, and
as God Almighty would have it, we flung our sheet Anchor down,
which is the biggest, and so stopt: Here we all pray'd to God to
forgive us our Sins, and to save us, or else to receive us into his
Heavenly Kingdom. If our sheet Anchor had given way, we had
been all drown'd: But I humbly thank God, it was his gracious
Mercy that saved us. There's one Captain <em>Fanel</em>'s Ship, three

<blockquote>

<p class="salutation"><em>SIR</em>,</p>

<p class="noi">I understand you are a Person concerned in making up a Collection
of some remarkable accidents that happened by the Violence
of the late dreadful Storm. I here present you with one of the like.
I presume you never heard before, nor hope may never hear again
of a Ship that was blown from her Anchors out of <em>Helford Haven</em>
to the <em>Isle of Wight</em>, in less than eight hours, <em>viz.</em> The Ship lay
in <em>Helford Haven</em> about two Leagues and a half Westward of
<em>Falmouth</em>, being laden with Tin, which was taken on Board from
<em>Guague</em> Wharf, about five or six miles up <em>Helford</em> River, the
Commanders name was <em>Anthony Jenkins</em>, who lives at <em>Falmouth</em>.
About eight Clock in the Evening before the Storm begun, the
said Commander and Mate came on Board and ordered the Crew
that he left on Board, which was but one Man and 2 Boys; that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>if the Wind should chance to blow hard (which he had some
apprehension of) to carry out the small Bower Anchor, and
moor the Ship by 2 Anchors, and gave them some other orders,
and his Mate and he went ashoar, and left the Crew aforesaid on
Board; about nine a Clock the Wind began to blow, then they
carried out the small Bower (as directed) it continued blowing
harder and harder at West North West, at last the Ship began to
drive, then they were forced to let go the best Bower Anchor
which brought the Ship up. The Storm increasing more, they let
go the Kedge Anchor, which was all they had to let go, so that
the Ship rid with four Anchors a head: Between eleven and twelve
a Clock the Wind came about West and by South in a most
Terrible and Violent manner, that notwithstanding a very high
Hill just to Windward of the Ship, and four Anchors ahead, she
was drove from all her Anchors; and about twelve a Clock drove
out of the Harbour without Anchor or Cable, nor so much as a
Boat left in case they could put into any Harbour. In dreadful
condition the Ship drove out clear of the Rocks to Sea, where the
Man with the two Boys consulted what to do, at last resolved to
keep her far enough to Sea, for fear of <em>Deadman's Head</em>, being a
point of Land between <em>Falmouth</em> and <em>Plimouth</em>, the latter of
which places they designed to run her in, if possible, to save their
Lives; the next morning in this frighted condition they steer'd her
clear of the Land (to the best of their skill) sometimes almost
under Water, and sometimes a top, with only the bonet of her
Foresail out, and the Fore yard almost lower'd to the Deck; but
instead of getting into <em>Plymouth</em> next day as intended, they were
far enough off that Port, for the next morning they saw Land,
which proved to be <em>Peverel</em> Point, a little to the Westward of the
<em>Isle of Wight</em>; so that they were in a worse Consternation then
before, for over-running their designed Port by seven a Clock,
they found themselves off the <em>Isle of Wight</em>; where they consulted
again what to do to save their Lives, one of the Boys was for
running her into the <em>Downs</em>, but that was objected against, by
reason they had no Anchors nor Boat, and the Storm blowing off
shore in the <em>Downs</em>, they should be blown on the unfortunate
<em>Goodwin Sands</em> and lost. Now comes the last consultation for
their lives, there was one of the Boys said he had been in a certain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>Creek in the <em>Isle of Wight</em>, where between the Rocks he believed
there was room enough to run the Ship in and save their Lives,
and desired to have the Helm from the Man, and he would venture
to steer the Ship into the said place, which he according did,
where there was only just room between Rock and Rock for the
Ship to come in, where she gave one blow or two against the
Rocks, and sunk immediately, but the Man and two Boys jumpt
ashore, and all the Lading being Tin was saved, (and for their
Conduct and Risk they run) they were all very well gratified, and
the Merchants well satisfied.</p>

<p class="noi">And here I cannot omit that great Notice has been taken of the
Towns-people of <em>Deal</em> who are blam'd, and I doubt not with
too much Reason for their great Barbarity in neglecting to save
the Lives of abundance of poor Wretches; who having hung
upon the Masts and Rigging of the Ships, or floated upon the
broken Pieces of Wrecks, had gotten a Shore upon the <em>Goodwin
Sands</em> when the Tide was out.</p>

<p>It was, without doubt, a sad Spectacle to behold the poor
Seamen walking too and fro upon the Sands, to view their
Postures, and the Signals they made for help, which, by the
Assistance of Glasses was easily seen from the Shore.</p>

<p>Here they had a few Hours Reprieve, but had neither present
Refreshment, nor any hopes of Life, for they were sure to be all
wash'd into another World at the Reflux of the Tide. Some
Boats are said to come very near them in quest of Booty, and in
search of Plunder, and to carry off what they could get, but no
Body concern'd themselves for the Lives of these miserable
Creatures.</p>

<p>And yet I cannot but incert what I have receiv'd from very
good Hands in behalf of one Person in that Town, whose
Humanity deserves this remembrance, and I am glad of the
Opportunity of doing some Justice in this Case to a Man of so
much Charity in a Town of so little.</p>

<p>Mr. <em>Thomas Powell</em>, of <em>Deal</em>, a Slop-Seller by Trade, and at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>that time Mayor of the Town. The Character of his Person I
need not dwell upon here, other than the ensuing Accounts will
describe, for when I have said he is a Man of Charity and
Courage, there is little I need to add to it, to move the Reader
to value both his Person, and his Memory; and tho' I am otherwise
a perfect Stranger to him, I am very well pleased to transmit
to Posterity the Account of his Behaviour, as an Example to all
good Christians to imitate on the like Occasions.</p>

<p>He found himself mov'd with Compasion at the Distresses of
the poor Creatures, whom he saw as aforesaid in that miserable
Condition upon the Sands, and the first Thing he did, he made
Application to the Custom-House Officers for the Assistance of
their Boats and Men, to save the Lives of as many as they could
come at, the Custom House Men rudely refus'd, either to send
their Men, or to part with their Boats.</p>

<p>Provoked with the unnatural Carriage of the Custom House
Officers, he calls the People about him; and finding some of the
Common People began to be more than ordinarily affected with
the Distresses of their Countrymen, and as he thought a little
enclin'd to venture; he made a general Offer to all that would
venture out, that he would pay them out of his own Pocket <em>5s.
per head</em> for all the Men whose Lives they could save, upon this
Proposal several offered themselves to go, if he would furnish
'em with Boats.</p>

<p>Finding the main Point clear, and that he had brought the
Men to be willing, he with their Assistance took away the
Custom House Boats by Force; and tho' he knew he could
not justify it, and might be brought into Trouble for it, and
particularly if it were lost, might be oblig'd to pay for it, yet he
resolv'd to venture that, rather than hazard the loss of his
Design, for the saving so many poor Men's Lives, and having
Mann'd their Boat with a Crew of stout honest Fellows, he with
them took away several other Boats from other Persons, who
made use of them only to Plunder and Rob, not regarding the
Distresses of the poor Men.</p>

<p>Being thus provided both with Men and Boats he sent them
off, and by this means brought on Shore above 200 Men, whose
Lives a few Minutes after, must infallibly ha' been lost.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span></p>

<p>Nor was this the End of his Care, for when the Tide came in,
and 'twas too late to go off again, for that all that were left were
swallow'd up with the Raging of the Sea, his Care was then to
relieve the poor Creatures, who he had sav'd, and who almost
dead with Hunger and Cold, were naked and starving.</p>

<p>And first he applied himself to the Queen's Agent <em>for Sick and
Wounded Seamen</em>, but he would not relieve them with One
Penny, whereupon, at his own Charge, he furnish'd them with
Meat, Drink and Lodging.</p>

<p>The next Day several of them died, the Extremities they had
suffer'd, having too much Master'd their Spirits, these he was
forc'd to bury also at his own Charge, the Agent still refusing to
Disburse one Penny.</p>

<p>After their Refreshment the poor Men assisted by the
Mayor, made a fresh Application to the Agent for Conduct
Money to help them up to <em>London</em>, but he answer'd he had no
Order, and would Disburse nothing, whereupon the Mayor
gave them all Money in their Pockets, and Passes to <em>Graves-End</em>.</p>

<p>I wish I could say with the same Freedom, that he receiv'd the
Thanks of the Government, and Reimbursement of his Money
as he deserv'd, but in this I have been inform'd, he met with
great Obstructions and Delays, tho' at last, after long Attendance,
upon a right Application I am inform'd he obtain'd the
repayment of his Money, and some small Allowance for his
Time spent in solliciting for it.</p>

<p>Nor can the Damage suffered in the River of <em>Thames</em> be
forgot. It was a strange sight to see all the Ships in the River
blown away, the Pool was so clear, that as I remember, not
above 4 Ships were left between the Upper part of <em>Wapping</em>,
and <em>Ratcliff Cross</em>, for the Tide being up at the Time when the
Storm blew with the greatest violence. No Anchors or Landfast,
no Cables or Moorings would hold them, the Chains which lay
cross the River for the mooring of Ships, all gave way.</p>

<p>The Ships breaking loose thus, it must be a strange sight to
see the Hurry and Confusion of it, and as some Ships had no
Body at all on Board, and a great many had none but a Man or
Boy left on Board just to look after the Vessel, there was nothing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>to be done, but to let every Vessel drive whither and how she
would.</p>

<p>Those who know the Reaches of the River, and how they lye,
know well enough, that the Wind being at South West Westerly,
the Vessels would naturally drive into the Bite or Bay from
<em>Ratcliff Cross</em> to <em>Lime-house Hole</em>, for that the River winding
about again from thence towards the New Dock at <em>Deptford</em>,
runs almost due South West, so that the Wind blew down one
Reach, and up another, and the Ships must of necessity drive
into the bottom of the Angle between both.</p>

<p>This was the Case, and as the Place is not large, and the
Number of Ships very great, the force of the Wind had driven
them so into one another, and laid them so upon one another
as it were in heaps, that I think a Man may safely defy all the
World to do the like.</p>

<p>The Author of this Collection had the curiosity the next day
to view the place and to observe the posture they lay in, which
nevertheless 'tis impossible to describe; there lay, by the best
Account he could take, few less than 700 sail of Ships, some
very great ones between <em>Shadwel</em> and <em>Limehouse</em> inclusive, the
posture is not to be imagined, but by them that saw it, some
Vessels lay heeling off with the Bow of another Ship over her
Waste, and the Stem of another upon her Fore-Castle, the Boltsprits
of some drove into the Cabbin Windows of others; some
lay with their Sterns tossed up so high, that the Tide flowed into
their Fore-Castles before they cou'd come to Rights; some lay
so leaning upon others, that the undermost Vessels wou'd sink
before the other could float; the numbers of Masts, Boltsprits
and Yards split and broke, the staving the Heads, and Sterns
and Carved Work, the tearing and destruction of Rigging, and
the squeezing of Boats to pieces between the Ships, is not to be
reckoned; but there was hardly a Vessel to be seen that had not
suffer'd some damage or other in one or all of these Articles.</p>

<p>There was several Vessels sunk in this hurry, but as they were
generally light Ships, the damage was chiefly to the Vessels; but
there were two Ships sunk with great quantity of Goods on
Board, the <em>Russel</em> Galley was sunk at <em>Lime-house</em>, being a great
part laden with Bale Goods for the <em>Streights</em>, and the <em>Sarah</em>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>Gally lading for <em>Leghorn</em>, sunk at an Anchor at <em>Blackwall</em>; and
though she was afterwards weighed and brought on shore, yet
her back was broke, or so otherwise disabled, as she was never
fit for the Sea; there were several Men drown'd in these last two
Vessels, but we could never come to have the particular number.</p>

<p>Near <em>Gravesend</em> several Ships drove on shoar below <em>Tilbury</em>
Fort, and among them five bound for the <em>West Indies</em>, but as
the shoar is ouzy and soft, the Vessels sat upright and easy, and
here the high Tides which follow'd, and which were the ruin of
so many in other places, were the deliverance of all these Ships
whose lading and value was very great, for the Tide rising to an
unusual height, floated them all off, and the damage was not so
great as was expected.</p>

<p>If it be expected I should give an account of the loss, and the
particulars relating to small Craft, <em>as the Sailors call it</em>, in the
River it is to look for what is impossible, other than by generals.</p>

<p>The Watermen tell us of above 500 Wheries lost, most of
which were not sunk only but dasht to pieces one against
another, or against the Shores and Ships, where they lay: Ship
Boats without number were driven about in every corner, sunk
and staved, and about 300 of them is supposed to be lost. Above
60 Barges and Lighters were found driven foul of the <em>Bridge</em>:
some Printed accounts tell us of sixty more sunk or staved
between the <em>Bridge</em> and <em>Hammersmith</em>.</p>

<p>Abundance of Lighters and Barges drove quite thro' the
<em>Bridge</em>, and took their fate below, whereof many were lost, so
that we Reckon by a modest account above 100 Lighters and
Barges lost and spoil'd in the whole, not reckoning such as with
small damage were recovered.</p>

<p>In all this confusion it could not be, but that many Lives were
lost, but as the <em>Thames</em> often times Buries those it drowns, there
has been no account taken. Two Watermen at <em>Black Fryars</em>
were drowned, endeavouring to save their Boat; and a Boat
was said to be Overset near <em>Fulham</em>, and five People drown'd:
According to the best account I have seen, about 22 People were
drown'd in the River upon this sad occasion, which considering
all circumstances is not a great many, and the damage to Shipping
computed with the vast number of Ships then in the River,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>the Violence of the Storm, and the heighth of the Tide, confirms
me in the Truth of that Opinion, which I have heard many
skilful Men own, <em>viz.</em> that the River of <em>Thames</em> is the best
Harbour of <em>Europe</em>.</p>

<p>The heighth of the Tide, as I have already observ'd, did no
great damage in the River of <em>Thames</em>, and I find none of the
Levels or Marshes, which lye on both sides the River overflowed
with it, it fill'd the Cellars indeed at <em>Gravesend</em>, and on both
sides in <em>London</em>, and the Alehouse-keepers suffered some loss
as to their Beer, but this damage is not worth mentioning with
what our Accounts give us from the <em>Severn</em>; which, besides the
particular Letters we have already quoted, the Reader may
observe in the following, what our general intelligence furnishes
us with.</p>

<p>The Damages in the City of <em>Gloucester</em> they compute at
12000 <em>l.</em> above 15000 Sheep drown'd in the Levels on the side
of the <em>Severne</em>, and the Sea Walls will cost, as these Accounts
tell us, 5000 <em>l.</em> to repair, all the Country lyes under Water for
20 or 30 Miles together on both sides, and the Tide rose three
Foot higher than the tops of the Banks.</p>

<p>At <em>Bristol</em> they tell us, The Tide fill'd their Cellars, spoil'd
1000 Hogsheads of Sugar, 1500 Hogsheds of Tobacco, and the
Damage they reckon at 100000 <em>l.</em> Above 80 People drown'd
in the Marshes and River, Several whole Families perishing
together.</p>

<p>The Harbour at <em>Plimouth</em>, the Castle at <em>Pendennis</em>, the
Cathederal at <em>Gloucester</em>, the great Church at <em>Berkely</em>, the
Church of St. <em>Stephen's</em> at <em>Bristol</em>; the Churches at <em>Blandford</em>,
at <em>Bridgewater</em>, at <em>Cambridge</em>, and generally the Churches all
over <em>England</em> have had a great share of the Damage.</p>

<p>In <em>King Road</em> at <em>Bristol</em>, the Damage by Sea is also very great;
the <em>Canterbury</em> store Ship was driven on Shoar, and twenty-five
of her Men drown'd, as by our account of the Navy will more
particularly appear, the <em>Richard and John</em>, the <em>George</em>, and the
<em>Grace</em> sunk, and the number of People lost is variously reported.</p>

<p>These Accounts in the four last Paragraphs being abstracted
from the publick Prints, and what other Persons collect, I desire
the Reader will observe, are not particularly vouch'd, but as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>they are all true in substance, they are so far to be depended
upon, and if there is any mistake it relates to Numbers, and
quantity only.</p>

<p>From <em>Yarmouth</em> we expected terrible News, and every one
was impatient till they saw the Accounts from thence, for as
there was a very great Fleet there, both of laden Colliers, <em>Russia</em>
Men, and others, there was nothing to be expected but a dreadful
Destruction among them.</p>

<p>But it pleas'd God to order Things there, that the loss was not
in Proportion like what it was in other Places, not but that it
was very great too.</p>

<p>The <em>Reserve</em> Man of War was come in but a day or two
before, Convoy to the great Fleet from <em>Russia</em>, and the Captain,
Surgeon and Clerk, who after so long a Voyage went on Shoar
with two Boats to refresh themselves, and buy Provisions, had
the Mortification to stand on Shoar, and see the Ship sink before
their Faces; she foundred about 11-a-Clock, and as the Sea went
too high for any help to go off from the Shoar to them, so their
own Boats being both on Shoar, there was not one Man sav'd;
one <em>Russia</em> Ship driving from her Anchors, and running foul of
a laden Collier sunk by his side, but some of her Men were sav'd
by getting on Board the Collier; three or four small Vessels were
driven out to Sea, and never heard of more; as for the Colliers,
tho' most of them were driven from their Anchors, yet going
away to Sea, we have not an account of many lost.</p>

<p>This next to the Providence of God, I give this reason for, first
by all Relations it appears that the Storm was not so violent
farther Northward, as it was there; and as it was not so Violent,
so neither did it continue so long: Now those Ships, who found
they could not ride it out in <em>Yarmouth</em> Roads, but slipping their
Cables went away to Sea, possibly as they went away to the
Northward, found the Weather more moderate at least, not so
violent, but it might be borne with, to this may be added, that
'tis well known to such as use the Coast after they had run the
length of <em>Flambro</em>, they had the benefit of the Weather Shoar,
and pretty high land, which if they took shelter under might
help them very much; these, with other Circumstances, made
the Damage much less than every Body expected, and yet as it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>was, it was bad enough as our Letter from <em>Hull</em> gives an Account.
At <em>Grimsby</em> it was still worse as to the Ships, where almost all
the Vessels were blown out of the Road, and a great many lost.</p>

<p>At <em>Plymouth</em> they felt a full Proportion of the Storm in its
utmost fury, the <em>Edystone</em> has been mention'd already, but it
was a double loss in that, the light House had not been long
down, when the <em>Winchelsea</em>, a homeward bound <em>Virginia</em> Man
was split upon the Rock, where that Building stood, and most
of her Men drowned.</p>

<p>Three other Merchant Ships were cast away in <em>Plimouth</em>
Road, and most of their Men lost: The <em>Monk</em> Man of War rode
it out, but was oblig'd to cut all her Masts by the Board, as
several Men of War did in other places.</p>

<p>At <em>Portsmouth</em> was a great Fleet, as has been noted already,
several of the Ships were blown quite out to Sea, whereof some
were never heard of more; the <em>Newcastle</em> was heard off upon
the Coast of <em>Sussex</em>, where she was lost with all their Men but
23; the <em>Resolution</em>, the <em>Eagle</em> advice Boat, and the <em>Litchfield</em>
Prize felt the same fate, only sav'd their Men: From <em>Cows</em> several
Ships were driven out to Sea, whereof one run on Shoar in
<em>Stokes-bay</em>, one full of Soldiers, and two Merchant Men have
never been heard off, as I could ever learn, abundance of the
Ships sav'd themselves by cutting down their Masts, and others
Stranded, but by the help of the ensuing Tides got off again.</p>

<p><em>Portsmouth</em>, <em>Plymouth</em>, <em>Weymouth</em>, and most of our Sea Port
Towns look'd as if they had been Bombarded, and the Damage
of them is not easily computed.</p>

<p>Several Ships from the <em>Downs</em> were driven over to the Coast
of <em>Holland</em>, and some sav'd themselves there; but several others
were lost there.</p>

<p>At <em>Falmouth</em> 11 Sail of Ships were stranded on the Shoar, but
most of them got off again.</p>

<p>In <em>Barstable</em> Harbour, a Merchant Ship outward bound was
over-set, and the express advice Boat very much shatter'd, and
the Quay of the Town almost destroy'd.</p>

<p>'Tis endless to attempt any farther Description of Losses, no
place was free either by Land or by Sea, every thing that was
capable felt the fury of the Storm; and 'tis hard to say, whether
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>was greater the loss by Sea, or by Land; the Multitude of
brave stout Sailors is a melancholy subject, and if there be any
difference gives the sad Ballance to the Account of the Damage
by Sea.</p>

<p>We had an Account of about 11 or 12 Ships droven over for
the Coast of <em>Holland</em>, most of which were lost, but the Men
saved, so that by the best Calculation I can make, we have not
lost less than 150 sail of Vessels of all sorts by the Storm; the
number of Men and other damages, are Calculated elsewhere.</p>

<p>We have several Branches of this Story which at first were too
easily credited, and put in Print, but upon more strict examination,
and by the discoveries of Time, appear'd otherwise, and
therefore are not set down.</p>

<p>It was in the design to have Collected the several Accounts of
the fatal effects of the Tempest abroad in Foreign Parts; but as
our Accounts came in from thence too imperfect to be depended
upon; the Collector of these Papers could not be satisfied to
offer them to the World, being willing to keep as much as
possible to the Terms of his Preface.</p>

<p>We are told there is an Abstract to the same purpose with this
in <em>France</em>, Printed at <em>Paris</em>, and which contains a strange variety
of Accidents in that Country.</p>

<p>If a particular of this can be obtained, the Author Promises
to put it into <em>English</em>, and adding to them the other Accounts,
which the rest of the World can afford, together with some other
Additions of the <em>English</em> Affairs, which could not be obtain'd
in time here shall make up the second part of this Work.</p>

<p>In the mean time the Reader may observe, <em>France</em> felt the
general shock, the Peers, and Ricebank at <em>Dunkirk</em>, the Harbour
at <em>Haver de Grace</em>, the Towns of <em>Calais</em> and <em>Bulloign</em> give
us strange Accounts.</p>

<p>All the Vessels in the Road before <em>Dunkirk</em>, being 23 or 27, I
am not certain, were dasht in pieces against the Peer Heads, not
one excepted, that side being a Lee shoar, the reason is plain,
there was no going off to Sea; and had it been so with us in the
<em>Downs</em> or <em>Yarmouth</em> Roads, it would have fared with us in the
same manner, for had there been no going off to Sea, 300 sail
in <em>Yarmouth</em> Roads had inevitably perisht.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span></p>

<p>At <em>Diepe</em> the like mischief happened, and in proportion <em>Paris</em>
felt the effects of it, as bad as <em>London</em>, and as a Gentleman who
came from thence since that time, affirmed it to me it was much
worse.</p>

<p>All the N. East Countries felt it, in <em>Holland</em> our accounts in
general are very dismal, but the Wind not being N.W. as at
former Storms, the Tyde did not drown them, nor beat so
directly upon their Sea Wall.</p>

<p>It is not very irrational to Judge, that had the Storm beat more
to the North West, it must have driven the Sea upon them in
such a manner, that all their Dikes and Dams could not have
sustained it, and what the consequence of such an Inundation
might ha' been they can best judge, who remember the last
terrible Irruption of the Sea there, which drowned several thousand
People, and Cattle without number.</p>

<p>But as our Foreign Accounts were not satisfactory enough to
put into this Collection, where we have promised to limit our
selves by just Vouchers, we purposely refer it all to a farther
description as before.</p>

<p>Several of our Ships were driven over to those parts, and some
lost there, and the story of our great Ships which rid it out, at
or near the <em>Gunfleet</em>, should have come in here, if the Collector
could have met with any Person that was in any of the said
Vessels, but as the accounts he expected did not come in the
time for the Impression, they were of necessity left out.</p>

<p>The <em>Association</em>, a Second Rate, on Board whereof was Sir
<em>Stafford Fairborn</em>, was one of these, and was blown from the
Mouth of the <em>Thames</em> to the Coast of <em>Norway</em>, a particular
whereof as Printed in the Annals of the Reign of Queen <em>Ann</em>'s
is as follows.</p>

<p class="subtitle p2"><em>An Account of Sir</em> Stafford Fairborne<em>'s Distress
in the late Storm</em>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="salutation"><em>SIR</em>,</p>

<p class="noi">Her Majesty's Ship <em>Association</em>, a second Rate of 96 Guns, commanded
by Sir <em>Stafford Fairborne</em>, Vice-Admiral of the Red, and
under him Captain <em>Richard Canning</em>, sailed from the <em>Downs</em> the
24th of <em>November</em> last, in Company with seven other Capital
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>Ships, under the Command of the Honourable Sir <em>Cloudesley
Shovel</em>, Admiral of the White, in their return from <em>Leghorn</em> up
the River. They anchored that Night off of the <em>Long-sand-head</em>.
The next Day struck Yards and Top-Masts. The 27th about three
in the Morning, the Wind at West South West, encreased to a
Hurricane, which drove the <em>Association</em> from her Anchors. The
Night was exceeding dark, but what was more Dreadful, the
<em>Galloper</em>, a very dangerous Sand, was under her Lee; so that she
was in Danger of striking upon it, beyond the Power of Man to
avoid it. Driving thus at the Mercy of the Waves, it pleased God,
that about five a Clock she passed over the tail of the <em>Galloper</em> in
seven Fathom of Water. The Sea boisterous and angry, all in a
Foam, was ready to swallow her up; and the Ship received at that
time a Sea on her Starboard-side, which beat over all, broke and
washed several half Ports, and forced in the entering Port. She
took in such a vast quantity of Water, that it kept her down upon
her side, and every Body believ'd, that she could not have risen
again, had not the Water been speedily let down into the hold
by scuttling the Decks. During this Consternation two of the
Lower-Gun-Deck-Ports were pressed open by this mighty weight
of Water, the most hazardous Accident, next to touching the
Ground, that could have happened to us. But the Port, that had
been forced open, being readily secured by the Direction and
Command of the Vice-Admiral, who, though much indisposed,
was upon Deck all that time, prevented any farther Mischief. As
the Ship still drove with the Wind, she was not long in this Shoal,
(where it was impossible for any Ship to have lived at that time)
but came into deeper Water, and then she had a smoother Sea.
However the Hurricane did not abate, but rather seemed to gather
Strength. For Words were no sooner uttered, but they were carried
away by the Wind, so that although those upon Deck spoke loud
and close to one another, yet they could not often distinguish
what was said; and when they opened their Mouths, their Breath
was almost taken away. Part of the Sprit Sail, tho' fast furled, was
blown away from the Yard. A Ten-Oar-Boat, that was lashed on
her Starboard-side, was often hove up by the Strength of the
Wind, and over-set upon her Gun-Wale. We plainly saw the
Wind skimming up the Water, as if it had been Sand, carrying it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>up into the Air, which was then so thick and gloomy, that Day
light, which should have been comfortable to us, did, but make it
appear more ghastly. The Sun by intervals peeped through the
corner of a Cloud, but soon disappearing, gave us a more melancholick
Prospect of the Weather. About 11 a Clock it dispersed
the Clouds, and the Hurricane abated into a more moderate
Storm, which drove us over to the Bank of <em>Flanders</em>, and thence
along the Coast of <em>Holland</em> and <em>Friesland</em> to the entrance of the
Elb, where the 4th of <em>December</em> we had almost as violent a Storm,
as when we drove from our Anchors, the Wind at North West,
driving us directly upon the Shoar. So that we must all have
inevitably perished, had not God mercifully favoured us about 10
a Clock at night with a South West Wind, which gave us an
opportunity to put to Sea. But being afterwards driven near the
Coast of <em>Norway</em>, the Ship wanting Anchors and Cables, our
Wood and Candles wholly expended; no Beer on Board, nor any
thing else in lieu; every one reduced to one quart of Water <em>per</em>
Day, the Men, who had been harrassed at <em>Belle Isle</em>; and in our
<em>Mediterranean</em> Voyage, now jaded by the continual Fatigues of
the Storms, falling sick every Day, the Vice-Admiral in this exigency
thought it advisable to put into <em>Gottenbourgh</em>, the only
Port where we could hope to be supplied. We arrived there the
11th of <em>December</em>, and having without lost of time got Anchors
and Cables from <em>Copenhagen</em>, and Provisions from <em>Gottenbourgh</em>,
we sailed thence the Third of <em>January</em>, with twelve Merchant
Men under our Convoy, all loaden with Stores for her
Majesty's Navy. The Eleventh following we prevented four
<em>French</em> Privateers from taking four of our Store-Ships. At Night
we anchored off the <em>Long-Sand-Head</em>. Weighed again the next
Day, but soon came to an Anchor, because it was very hazy
Weather. Here we rid against a violent Storm, which was like to
have put us to Sea. But after three Days very bad Weather, we
weighed and arrived to the <em>Buoy of the Nore</em> the 23d of <em>January</em>,
having run very great Risks among the Sands. For we had not
only contrary Winds, but also very tempestuous Winds. We lost
28 Men by Sickness, contracted by the Hardships which they
endur'd in the bad Weather; and had not Sir <em>Stafford Fairborne</em>
by his great care and diligence, got the Ship out of <em>Gottenbourgh</em>,
and by that prevented her being frozen up, most part of the Sailers
had perished afterwards by the severity of the Winter, which is
intolerable Cold in those parts.</p></blockquote>

<em>Of the Damage to the Navy</em></h3>

<p class="noi">This is a short but terrible Article, there was one Ship called the
<em>York</em>, which was lost about 3 days before the great Storm off of
<em>Harwich</em>, but most of the Men were saved.</p>

<p>The loss immediately sustain'd in the Royal Navy during the
Storm, is included in the List hereunto annex'd, as appears from
the Navy Books.</p>

<p>The damage done to the Ships that were sav'd, is past our
Power to compute. The Admiral, Sir <em>Cloudesley Shovel</em> with the
great Ships, had made sail but the day before out of the <em>Downs</em>,
and were taken with the Storm as they lay at or near the
<em>Gunfleet</em>, where they being well provided with Anchors and
Cables, rid it out, tho' in great extremity, expecting death every
minute.</p>

<p>The loss of small Vessels hir'd into the Service, and tending
the Fleet, is not included in this, nor can well be, several such
Vessels, and some with Soldiers on Board, being driven away to
Sea, and never heard of more.</p>

<p>The loss of the <em>Light-House</em>, call'd the <em>Eddystone</em> at <em>Plymouth</em>,
is another Article, of which we never heard any particulars
other than this; that at Night it was standing, and in the
Morning all the upper part from the Gallery was blown down,
and all the People in it perished, and by a particular Misfortune,
Mr. <em>Winstanly</em>, the Contriver of it, a Person whose loss is very
much regreted by such as knew him, as a very useful Man to his
Country: The loss of that <em>Light-House</em> is also a considerable
Damage, as 'tis very doubtful whether it will be ever attempted
again, and as it was a great Security to the Sailors, many a good
Ship having been lost there in former Times.</p>

<p>It was very remarkable, that, as we are inform'd, at the same
time the <em>Light-House</em> abovesaid was blown down, the Model
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>of it in Mr. <em>Windstanly</em>'s House at <em>Littlebury</em> in <em>Essex</em>, above
200 Miles from the <em>Light-House</em>, fell down, and was broken to
pieces.</p>

<p>There are infinite Stories of like nature with these, the Disasters
at Sea are full of a vast variety, what we have recommended
to the view of the World in this History, may stand as an
Abridgment; and the Reader is only to observe that these are
the short Representations, by which he may guess at the most
dreadful Night, these parts of the World ever saw.</p>

<p>To relate all Things, that report Furnishes us with, would be
to make the story exceed common probability, and look like
Romance.</p>

<p>Tis a sad and serious Truth, and this part of it is preserv'd to
Posterity to assist them in reflecting on the Judgments of God,
and handing them on for the Ages to come.</p>

<h2><em>Of the</em> Earthquake</h2>

<p class="noi">Tho' this was some time after the Storm, yet as the Accounts of
the Storm bring it with them in the following Letters, we cannot
omit it.</p>

<p>The two following Letters are from the respective Ministers
of <em>Boston</em> and <em>Hull</em>, and relate to the Account of the Earthquake,
which was felt over most part of the County of <em>Lincoln</em> and the
East Riding of <em>Yorkshire</em>.</p>

<p>The Letter from <em>Hull</em>, from the Reverend Mr. <em>Banks</em>, Minister
of the Place, is very particular, and deserves intire Credit, both
from the extraordinary Character of the worthy Gentleman
who writes it, and from its exact Correspondence with other
Accounts.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="salutation"><em>SIR</em>,</p>

<p class="noi">I receiv'd yours, wherein you acquaint me with a Design that (I
doubt not) will meet with that Applause and Acceptance from
the World which it deserves; but am in no capacity to be any way
serviceable to it my self, the late Hurricane having more frighted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>than hurt us in these Parts. I doubt not but your Intelligence in
general from the Northern Parts of the Nation, supplies you with
as little Matter as what you have from these hereabouts, it having
been less violent and mischievous that way. Some Stacks of Chimneys
were over-turn'd here, and from one of them a little Child
of my own was (thanks be to God) almost miraculously preserv'd,
with a Maid that lay in the Room with him. I hear of none else
this way that was so much as in danger, the Storm beginning here
later than I perceive it did in some other Places, its greatest
Violence being betwixt 7 and 8 in the Morning, when most People
were stirring.</p>

<p>The Earthquake, which the Publick Accounts mention to have
happen'd at <em>Hull</em> and <em>Lincoln</em> upon the 28th <em>ult.</em> was felt here by
some People about 6 in the Evening, at the same time that People
there, as well as at <em>Grantham</em> and other Places, perceived it. We
have some flying Stories about it which look like fabulous, whose
Credit therefore I wou'd not be answerable for; as, that upon
<em>Lincoln-Heath</em> the Ground was seen to open, and Flashes of Fire
to issue out of the Chasm.</p>

<p>I doubt this Account will hardly be thought worth the Charge
of Passage: Had there been any thing else of note, you had been
very readily serv'd by,</p>

<p class="signature">

<em>Boston</em>, Jan. 8. 1703.
</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p class="salutation p4"><em>SIR</em>,</p>

<p class="noi">I am afraid that you will believe me very rude, that yours, which
I receiv'd the 12th of <em>April</em>, has not sooner receiv'd such an
Answer as you expect and desire, and truly I think deserve; for, a
Design so generous, as to undertake to transmit to Posterity,
A Memorial of the dreadful Effects of the late terrible Tempest
(that when God's Judgments are in the World, they may be made
so publick, as to ingage the Inhabitants of the Earth to learn
Righteousness) ought to receive all possible Encouragement.</p>

<p>But the true Reason why I writ no sooner, was, Because, by the
most diligent Enquiries I cou'd make, I cou'd not learn what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>Harm that dreadful Tempest did in the <em>Humber</em>; neither indeed
can I yet give you any exact Account of it: for, the great Mischief
was done in the Night; which was so Pitch-dark, that of above 80
Ships that then rid in the <em>Humber</em>, about <em>Grimsby</em> Road, very
few escap'd some Loss or other, and none of 'em were able to
give a Relation of any body but themselves.</p>

<p>The best Account of the Effects of the Storm in the <em>Humber</em>,
that I have yet met with, I received but Yesterday, from Mr.
<em>Peter Walls</em>, who is Master of that Watch-Tower, call'd the
<em>Spurn-Light</em>, at the <em>Humber</em> Mouth, and was present there on the
Night of the 26th of <em>November</em>, the fatal Night of the Storm.</p>

<p>He did verily believe that his Pharos (which is above 20 Yards
high) wou'd have been blown down; and the Tempest made the
Fire in it burn so vehemently, that it melted down the Iron-bars
on which it laid, like Lead; so that they were forced, when the
Fire was by this means almost extinguished, to put in new Bars,
and kindle the Fire a-fresh, which they kept in till the Morning
Light appear'd: And then <em>Peter Walls</em> observed about six or seven
and twenty Sail of Ships, all driving about the <em>Spurn-Head</em>, some
having cut, others broke their Cables, but all disabled, and render'd
helpless. These were a part of the two Fleets that then lay
in the <em>Humber</em>, being put in there by stress of Weather a day or
two before, some from <em>Russia</em>, and the rest of 'em <em>Colliers</em>, to and
from <em>Newcastle</em>. Of these, three were driven upon an Island call'd
the <em>Den</em>, within the <em>Spurn</em> in the Mouth of the <em>Humber</em>.</p>

<p>The first of these no sooner touch'd Ground, but she over-set,
and turn'd up her Bottom; out of which, only one of six (the
Number of that Ship's Company) was lost, being in the Shrowds:
the other five were taken up by the second Ship, who had sav'd
their Boat. In this Boat were saved all the Men of the three Ships
aforementioned (except as before excepted) and came to Mr.
<em>Walls</em>'s House, at the <em>Spurn-Head</em>, who got them good Fires, and
all Accommodations necessary for them in such a Distress. The
second Ship having no body aboard, was driven to Sea, with
the Violence of the Tempest, and never seen or heard of more.
The third, which was then a-ground, was (as he supposes) broken
up and driven; for nothing, but some Coals that were in her, was
to be seen the next Morning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>

Another Ship, the Day after, <em>viz.</em> the 27th of <em>November</em>, was
riding in <em>Grimsby</em> Road, and the Ships Company (except two
Boys) being gone a-shore, the Ship, with the two Lads in her,
drive directly out of <em>Humber</em>, and was lost, tho' 'tis verily believ'd
the two Boys were saved by one of the <em>Russia</em> Ships, or Convoys.</p>

<p>The same Day, in the Morning, one <em>John Baines</em>, a <em>Yarmouth</em>
Master, was in his Ship, riding in <em>Grimsby</em> Road, and by the
Violence of the Storm, some other Ships coming foul upon him,
part of his Ship was broken down, and was driven towards Sea;
whereupon he anchored under <em>Kilnsey-Land</em>, and with his Crew
came safe a-shore, in his Boat, but the Ship was never seen more.</p>

<p>The remainder of the six or seven and twenty Sail aforesaid,
being (as was before observed) driven out of the <em>Humber</em>, very
few, if any of 'em, were ever heard of; and 'tis rationally believ'd,
that all, or the most of them, perished. And indeed, altho' the
Storm was not so violent here as it was about <em>Portsmouth</em>, <em>Yarmouth</em>
Roads, and the Southern Coast, yet the Crews of the three
Ships above-mentioned declare, that they were never out in so
dismal a Night as that was of the 26th of <em>November</em>, in which the
considerable Fleet aforesaid rid in <em>Grimsby</em> Road in the <em>Humber</em>;
for most of the 80 Sail broke from their Anchors, and run foul
one upon another; but by reason of the Darkness of the Night,
they cou'd see very little of the Mischief that was done.</p>

<p>This is the best Account I can give you at present of the Effects
of the Tempest in the <em>Humber</em>; whereas had the Enquiry been
made immediately after the Storm was over, a great many more
of remarkable Particulars might have been discover'd.</p>

<p>As to the Earthquake here, tho' I perceiv'd it not my self (being
then walking to visit a sick Parishoner) yet it was so sensibly felt
by so many Hundreds, that I cannot in the least question the
Truth and Certainty of it.</p>

<p>It happen'd here, and in these Parts, upon <em>Innocent</em>'s Day, the
28th of <em>December</em>, being <em>Tuesday</em>, about Five of the Clock in the
Evening, or thereabout. Soon after I gave as particular Account
as I cou'd learn of it, to that ingenious Antiquary Mr. <em>Thorsby</em> of
<em>Leeds</em> in <em>Yorkshire</em>, but had no time to keep a Copy of my Letter
to him, nor have I leisure to transcribe a Copy of this to you,
having so constant a Fatigue of Parochial business to attend; nor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>will my Memory serve me to recollect all the Circumstances of
that Earthquake, as I sent them to Mr. <em>Thoresby</em>; and possibly he
may have communicated that Letter to you, or will upon your
least intimation, being a generous Person, who loves to communicate
any thing that may be serviceable to the Publick.</p>

<p>However, lest I shou'd seem to decline the gratifying your
Request, I will recollect, and here set down, such of the Circumstances
of that Earthquake as do at present occur to my Memory.</p>

<p>It came with a Noise like that of a Coach in the Streets, and
mightily shak'd both the Glass Windows, Pewter, <em>China</em> Pots and
Dishes, and in some places threw them down off the Shelves on
which they stood. It did very little Mischief in this Town, except
the throwing down a Piece of one Chimney. Several Persons
thought that a great Dog was got under the Chair they sat upon;
and others fell from their Seats, for fear of falling. It frighted
several Persons, and caus'd 'em for a while to break off their
Reading, or Writing, or what they were doing.</p>

<p>They felt but one Shake here: but a Gentleman in <em>Nottinghamshire</em>
told me, that being then lame upon his Bed, he felt three
Shakes, like the three Rocks of a Cradle, to and again.</p>

<p>At <em>Laceby</em> in <em>Lincolnshire</em>, and in several other Parts of that
County, as well as of the Counties of <em>York</em> and <em>Nottingham</em>, the
Earthquake was felt very sensibly; and particularly at <em>Laceby</em>
aforesaid. There happen'd this remarkable Story.</p>

<p>On <em>Innocent</em>'s Day, in the Afternoon, several Morrice-Dancers
came thither from <em>Grimsby</em>; and after they had Danc'd and play'd
their Tricks, they went towards <em>Alesby</em>, a little Town not far off:
and as they were going about Five a Clock, they felt two such
terrible Shocks of the Earth, that they had much ado to hold their
Feet, and thought the Ground was ready to open, and swallow
'em up. Whereupon thinking that God was angry at 'em for
playing the Fool, they return'd immediately to <em>Laceby</em> in a great
Fright, and the next Day home, not daring to pursue their intended
Circuit and Dancing.</p>

<p>I think 'tis the Observation of Dr. <em>Willis</em>, that upon an Earthquake
the Earth sends forth noisome Vapours which infect the
Air, as the Air does our Bodies: and accordingly it has prov'd
here, where we have ever since had a most sickly time, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>greatest Mortality that has been in this Place for 15 Years last
past: and so I believe it has been over the greatest part of <em>England</em>.
This, SIR, is the best Account I can give you of the Earthquake,
which had com'd sooner, but that I was desirous to get likewise
the best Account I cou'd of the Effects of the Storm in the <em>Humber</em>.
My humble Service to the Undertakers: and if in any thing I am
capable to serve them or you, please freely to command,</p>

<p class="noi">We have a farther Account of this in two Letters from Mr.
<em>Thoresby</em>, F.R.S. and written to the Publisher of the Philosophical
Transactions, and printed in their Monthly Collection,
No. 289. as follows, which is the same mentioned by Mr. <em>Banks</em>.</p>

<p class="subtitle p2">
<em>Part of two Letters from Mr.</em> Thoresby, F.R.S. <em>to the
Publisher, concerning an Earthquake, which happen'd
in some Places of the North of</em> England, <em>the
28th of</em> December 1703.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="noi">You have heard, no doubt, of the late <em>Earthquake</em> that affected
some part of the North, as the dreadful Storm did the South. It
being most observable at <em>Hull</em>, I was desirous of an Account from
thence that might be depended upon; and therefore writ to the
very obliging Mr. <em>Banks</em>, Prebendary of <em>York</em>, who being Vicar
of <em>Hull</em>, was the most suitable Person I knew to address my self
unto: and he being pleased to favour me with a judicious Account
of it, I will venture to communicate it to you, with his pious
Reflection thereupon. 'As to the Earthquake you mention, it was
felt here on <em>Tuesday</em> the 28th of the last Month, which was
<em>Childermas</em> Day, about three or four Minutes after Five in the
Evening. I confess I did not feel it my self; for I was at that moment
walking to visit a sick Gentleman, and the Noise in the Streets,
and my quick Motion, made it impossible, I believe, for me to
feel it: but it was so almost universally felt, that there can be no
manner of doubt of the Truth of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <em>Peers</em>, my Reader, (who is an ingenious good Man) was
then at his Study, and Writing; but the heaving up of his Chair
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>and his Desk, the Shake of his Chamber, and the rattling of his
Windows, did so amaze him, that he was really affrighted, and
was forc'd for a while to give over his Work: and there are twenty
such Instances amongst Tradesmen, too tedious to repeat. My
Wife was then in her Closet, and thought her <em>China</em> would have
come about her Ears, and my Family felt the Chairs mov'd, in
which they were sitting by the Kitchen Fire-side, and heard such
a Rattle of the Pewter and Windows as almost affrighted them. A
Gentlewoman not far off said, her Chair lifted so high, that she
thought the great Dog had got under it, and to save her self from
falling, slipt off her Chair. I sent to a House where part of a
Chimney was shak'd down, to enquire of the particulars; they
kept Ale, and being pretty full of Company that they were merry,
they did not perceive the Shock, only heard the Pewter and
Glass-windows dance; but the Landlady's Mother, who was in a
Chamber by her self, felt the Shock so violent, that she verily
believed the House to be coming down (as part of the Chimney
afore mention'd did at the same Moment) and cried out in a
Fright, and had fall'n, but that she catched hold of a Table. It
came and went suddenly, and was attended with a Noise like the
Wind, though there was then a perfect Calm.'</p>

<p>From other Hands I have an Account that it was felt in <em>Beverly</em>,
and other Places; at <em>South Dalton</em> particularly, where the Parson's
Wife (my own Sister) being alone in her Chamber, was sadly
frighted with the heaving up of the Chair she sat in, and the very
sensible Shake of the Room, especially the Windows, <em>&amp;c.</em> A
Relation of mine, who is a Minister near <em>Lincoln</em>, being then at a
Gentleman's House in the Neighbourhood, was amaz'd at the
Moving of the Chairs they sat upon, which was so violent, he
writes every Limb of him was shaken; I am told also from a true
Hand, that so nigh us as <em>Selby</em>, where Mr. <em>Travers</em>, a Minister,
being in his Study writing, was interrupted much as Mr. <em>Peers</em>
above-mentioned; which minds me of worthy Mr. <em>Bank</em>'s serious
Conclusion. 'And now I hope you will not think it unbecoming
my Character to make this Reflection upon it, <em>viz.</em> that Famines,
Pestilences and Earthquakes, are joyned by our Blessed Saviour,
as portending future Calamities, and particularly the Destruction
of <em>Jerusalem</em> and the <em>Jewish</em> State; if not the End of the World,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>St. <em>Matth.</em> 24. 7. And if, as Philosophers observe, those gentler
Convulsions within the Bowels of the Earth, which give the
Inhabitants but an easie Jog, do usually portend the Approach of
some more dreadful Earthquake; then surely we have Reason to
fear the worst, because I fear we so well deserve it, and pray God
of his infinite Mercy to avert his future Judgments.'</p>

<p class="p2">Since my former Account of the Earthquake at <em>Hull</em>, my Cousin
<em>Cookson</em> has procured to me the following Account from his
Brother, who is a Clergyman near <em>Lincoln</em>, viz, That he, being
about Five in the Evening, <em>December</em> the 20th past, set with a
neighbouring Minister at his House about a Mile from <em>Navenby</em>,
they were surpriz'd with a sudden Noise, as if it had been of two
or three Coaches driven furiously down the Yard, whereupon the
Servant was sent to the Door, in Expectation of some Strangers;
but they quickly perceived what it was, by the shaking of the
Chairs they sat upon; they could perceive the very Stones move:
the greatest Damage was to the Gentlewoman of the House, who
was put into such a Fright, that she miscarried two Days after.
He writes, they were put into a greater Fright upon the Fast-day;
when there was so violent a Storm, they verily thought the Church
would have fallen upon them. We had also at <em>Leedes</em> a much
greater Storm the Night preceding the Fast, and a stronger Wind
that Day, than when the fatal Storm was in the South; but a good
Providence timed this well, to quicken our too cold Devotions.</p></blockquote>

<h2><em>Of remarkable</em> Deliverances</h2>

<p class="noi">As the sad and remarkable Disasters of this Terrible Night were
full of a Dismal Variety, so the Goodness of Providence, in the
many remarkable Deliverances both by Sea and Land, have
their Share in this Account, as they claim an equal Variety and
Wonder.</p>

<p>The Sense of extraordinary Deliverances, as it is a Mark of
Generous Christianity, so I presume 'tis the best Token, that a
good Use is made of the Mercies receiv'd.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span></p>

<p>The Persons, who desire a thankful Acknowledgement should
be made to their Merciful Deliverer, and the Wonders of his
Providence remitted to Posterity, shall never have it to say, that
the Editor of this Book refus'd to admit so great a Subject
a Place in these Memoirs; and therefore, with all imaginable
Freedom, he gives the World the Particulars from their own
Mouths, and under their own Hands.</p>

<p>The first Account we have from the Reverend Mr. <em>King</em>,
Lecturer at St. <em>Martins</em> in the Fields, as follows.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="salutation"><em>SIR</em>,</p>

<p class="noi">The short Account I now send to shew the Providence of God in
the late Dreadful Storm, (if yet it comes not too late) I had from
the Mouth of the Gentleman himself, Mr. <em>Woodgate Gisser</em> by
Name, who is a Neighbour of mine, living in St. <em>Martin's-street</em>
in the Parish of St. <em>Martins</em> in the Fields, and a Sufferer in the
common Calamity; is as follows, <em>viz.</em></p>

<p>Between Two and Three of the Clock in the Morning, my
Neighbour's Stack of Chimneys fell, and broke down the Roof of
my Garret into the Passage going up and down Stairs; upon
which, I thought it convenient to retire into the Kitchen with my
Family; where we had not been above a Quarter of an Hour,
before my Wife sent her Maid to fetch some Necessaries out of a
Back Parlour Closet, and as she had shut the Door, and was
upon her Return, the very same Instant my Neighbour's Stack of
Chimneys, on the other Side of the House, fell upon my Stack,
and beat in the Roof, and so drove down the several Floors
through the Parlour into the Kitchen, where the Maid was buried
near Five Hours in the Rubbish, without the least Damage or Hurt
whatsoever: This her miraculous Preservation was occasion'd (as,
I afterwards with Surprize found) by her falling into a small
Cavity near the Bed, and afterwards (as she declar'd) by her
creeping under the Tester that lay hollow by Reason of some
Joices that lay athwart each other, which prevented her perishing
in the said Rubbish: About Eight in the Morning, when I helped
her out of the Ruins, and asked her how she did, and why she did
not cry out for Assistance, since she was not (as I suppos'd she
had been) dead, and so to let me know she was alive; her Answer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>was, that truly she for her Part had felt no Hurt, and was not the
least affrighted, but lay quiet; and which is more, even slumbred
until then.</p>

<p>The Preservation of my self, and the rest of my Family, about
Eleven in Number, was, next to the Providence of God, occasion'd
by our running into a Vault almost level with the Kitchen upon
the Noise and Alarm of the Falling of the Chimneys, which
breaking through three Floors, and about two Minutes in passing,
gave us the Opportunities of that Retreat. Pray accept of this
short Account from</p>

</p></blockquote>

<p class="noi">Another is from a Reverend Minister at &mdash;&mdash; whose Name is to
his Letter as follows.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="salutation"><em>SIR</em>,</p>

<p class="noi">I thank you for your charitable Visit not long since; I could have
heartily wish'd your Business would have permitted you to have
made a little longer Stay at the parsonage, and then you might
have taken a stricter View of the Ruins by the late terrible Wind.
Seeing you are pleas'd to desire from me a more particular
Account of that sad Disaster; I have for your fuller Satisfaction
sent you the best I am able to give; and if it be not so perfect, and
so exact a one, as you may expect, you may rely upon me it is a
true, and a faithful one, and that I do not impose upon you, or
the World in the least in any Part of the following Relation. I shall
not trouble you with the Uneasiness the Family was under all the
fore Part of the Evening, even to a Fault, as I thought, and told
them, I did not then apprehend the Wind to be much higher than
it had been often on other Times; but went to Bed, hoping we
were more afraid than we needed to have been: when in Bed, we
began to be more sensible of it, and lay most of the Night awake,
dreading every Blast till about Four of the Clock in the Morning,
when to our thinking it seemed a little to abate; and then we fell
asleep, and slept till about Six of the Clock, at which Time my
Wife waking, and calling one of her Maids to rise, and come to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>the Children, the Maid rose, and hasten'd to her; she had not
been up above Half an Hour, but all on the sudden we heard a
prodigious Noise, as if part of the House had been fallen down; I
need not tell you the Consternation we were all in upon this
Alarm; in a Minutes Time, I am sure, I was surrounded with all
my Infantry, that I thought I should have been overlay'd; I had
not even Power to stir one Limb of me, much less to rise, though
I could not tell how to lie in Bed. The Shrieks and the Cries of my
dear Babes perfectly stun'd me; I think I hear them still in my
Ears, I shall not easily, I am confident, if ever, forget them. There
I lay preaching Patience to those little Innocent Creatures, till the
Day began to appear.</p>

<p><em>Preces &amp; Lachrimcæ</em>, Prayers and Tears, the Primitive Christians
Weapons, we had great Plenty of to defend us withal; but had the
House all fallen upon our Heads, we were in that Fright as we
could scarce have had Power to rise for the present, or do any
thing for our Security. Upon our rising, and sending a Servant
to view what she could discover, we soon understood that the
Chimney was fallen down, and that with its Fall it had beaten
down a great part of that End of the House, <em>viz.</em> the Upper
Chamber, and the Room under it, which was the Room I chose
for my Study: The Chimney was thought as strong, and as well
built as most in the Neighbourhood; and it surpriz'd the Mason
(whom I immediately sent for to view it) to see it down: but that
which was most surprizing to me, was the Manner of its Falling;
had it fallen almost any other Way than that it did, it must in all
Likelihood have killed the much greater part of my Family, for
no less than Nine of us lay at that End of the House, my Wife and
Self, and Five Children, and Two Servants, a Maid, and a Man
then in my Pay, and so a Servant, though not by the Year: The
Bed my Eldest Daughter and the Maid lay in joyned as near as
possible to the Chimney, and it was within a very few Yards of
the Bed that we lay in; so that as <em>David</em> said to <em>Jonathan</em>, there
seem'd to be but one single Step between Death and us, to all
outward Appearance. One Thing I cannot omit, which was very
remarkable and surprizing: It pleased God so to order it, that in
the Fall of the House two great Spars seem'd to fall so as to pitch
themselves on an End, and by that Means to support that other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>Part of the House which adjoined to the Upper Chamber; or else
in all Likelihood, that must also have fallen too at the same Time.
The Carpenter (whom we sent for forthwith) when he came, ask'd
who plac'd those two Supporters, supposing somebody had been
there before him; and when he was told, those two Spars in the
Fall so plac'd themselves, he could scarce believe it possible; it
was done so artificially, that he declar'd, they scarce needed to
have been removed.</p>

<p>In short, Sir, it is impossible to describe the Danger we were in;
you your self was an Eye-witness of some Part of what is here
related; and I once more assure you, the whole Account I have
here given you is true, and what can be attested by the whole
Family. None of all those unfortunate Persons who are said to
have been killed with the Fall of a Chimney, could well be much
more expos'd to Danger than we were; it is owing wholly to
that watchful Providence to whom we all are indebted for every
Minute of our Lives, that any of us escaped; none but he who
never sleeps nor slumbers could have secured us. I beseech
Almighty God to give us All that due Sense as we ought to have
of so great and so general Calamity; that we truly repent us of
those Sins that have so long provoked his Wrath against us, and
brought down so heavy a Judgment as this upon us. O that we
were so wise as to consider it, and to <em>sin no more lest a worse
thing come upon us</em>! That it may have this happy Effect upon all
the sinful Inhabitants of this Land is, and shall be, the Dayly
Prayer of Dear Sir,</p>

<p class="noi">Another Account from a Reverend Minister in <em>Dorsetshire</em>, take
as follows, <em>viz.</em></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="salutation"><em>SIR</em>,</p>

<p class="noi">As you have desired an Account of the Disasters occasion'd by
the late Tempest, (which I can assure you was in these Parts very
Terrible) so I think my self oblig'd to let you know, that there was
a great Mixture of Mercy with it: For though the Hurricane was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>frightful, and very mischievous, yet God's gracious Providence
was therein very remarkable, in restraining its Violence from an
universal Destruction: for then there was a Commotion of the
Elements of Air, Earth and Water, which then seemed to outvie
each other in Mischief; for (in <em>David</em>'s Expression, 2 <em>Sam.</em> 22. 8.)
<em>The Earth trembled and quak'd, the Foundations of the Heavens
mov'd and shook, because God was angry</em>: and yet, when all was
given over for lost, we found our selves more scar'd than hurt;
for our Lives was given us for a Prey, and the Tempest did us only
so much Damage, as to make us sensible that it might have done
us a great deal more, had it not been rebuk'd by the God of
Mercy; the Care of whose Providence has been visibly seen in our
wonderful Preservations. My Self and Three more of this Parish
were then strangely rescued from the Grave: I narrowly escaped
with my Life, where I apprehended nothing of Danger; for going
out about Midnight to give Orders to my Servants to secure the
House, and Reeks of Corn and Furses from being blown all
away; as soon as I mov'd out of the Place were I stood, I heard
something of a great Weight fall close behind me, and a little after
going out with a Light, to see what it was, I found it to be the
great Stone which covered the Top of my Chimney to keep out
the Wet; it was almost a Yard square, and very thick, weighing
about an Hundred and Fifty Pound. It was blown about a Yard
off from the Chimney, and fell Edge-long, and cut the Earth,
about four Inches deep, exactly between my Foot-steps; and a
little after, whilst sitting under the Clavel of my Kitchen Chimney,
and reaching out my Arm for some Fewel to mend the Fire, I was
again strangely preserved from being knock'd on the Head by a
Stone of great Weight; it being about a Foot long, Half a Foot
broad, and two Inches thick: for as soon as I had drawn in my
Arm, I felt something brush against my Elbow, and presently I
heard the Stone fall close by my Foot, a third Part of which was
broken off by the Violence of the Fall, and skarr'd my Ancle, but
did not break the Skin; it had certainly killed me, had it fallen
while my Arm was extended. The Top of my Wheat Rick was
blown off, and some of the Sheaves were carried a Stones Cast,
and with that Violence, that one of them, at that Distance, struck
down one <em>Daniel Fookes</em> a late Servant of the Lady <em>Napier</em>, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>so forceably, that he was taken up dead, and to all Appearance
remain'd so a great while; but at last was happily recover'd to
Life again. His Mother, poor Widow, was at the same time more
fatally threatned at Home, and her Bed had certainly prov'd her
Grave, had not the first Noise awaken'd and scar'd her out of
Bed; and she was scarce gotten to the Door, when the House
fell all in: The Smith's Wife likewise being scar'd at such a Rate,
leapt out of Bed, with the little Child in her Arms, and ran hastily
out of Doors naked, without Hose or Shooes, to a Neighbour's
House; and by that hasty Flight, both their Lives were wonderfully
preserved. The Sheets of Lead on <em>Lytton</em> Church, were rolled
up like Sheets of Parchment, and blown off to a great Distance.
At <em>Strode</em>, a large Apple Tree, being about a Foot in Square, was
broken off cleverly like a Stick, about four Foot from the Root,
and carried over an Hedge about ten Foot high; and cast, as if
darted, (with the Trunk forward) above fourteen Yards off. And
I am credibly inform'd, that at <em>Ellwood</em> in the Parish of <em>Abbotsbury</em>,
a large Wheat Rick (belonging to one <em>Jolyffe</em>) was cleverly
blown, with its Staddle, off from the Stones, and set down on the
Ground in very good Order. I would fain know of the Atheist
what mov'd his <em>Omnipotent Matter</em> to do such Mischief, <em>&amp;c.</em></p>

<p class="center"><em>A great Preservation in the late Storm</em></p>

<p class="noi">About Three of the Clock in the Morning, the Violence of the
Wind blew down a Stack of Chimneys belonging to the dwelling
House of Dr. <em>Gideon Harvey</em>, (situate in St. <em>Martin</em>'s Lane over
against the Street End) on the back Part of the next House,
wherein dwells Mr. <em>Robert Richards</em> an Apothecary, at the Sign
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>of the Unicorn; and Capt. <em>Theodore Collier</em> and his Family lodges
in the same. The Chimney fell with that Force as made them
pierce thro' the Roofs and all the Floors, carrying them down
quite to the Ground. The two Families, consisting of Fourteen,
Men, Women, and Children, besides Three that came in from
the next House, were at that Instant dispos'd of as follows, a
Footman that us'd to lie in the back Garret, had not a Quarter of
an Hour before remov'd himself into the fore Garret, by which
means he escap'd the Danger: In the Room under that lay Capt.
<em>Collier</em>'s Child, of Two Months old, in Bed with the Nurse, and
a Servant Maid lay on the Bed by her; the Nurse's Child lying in
a Cribb by the Bed-side, which was found, with the Child safe in
it, in the Kitchen, where the Nurse and Maid likewise found
themselves; their Bed being shatter'd in Pieces, and they a little
bruis'd by falling down Three Stories: Capt. <em>Collier</em>'s Child was
in about Two Hours found unhurt in some Pieces of the Bed
and Curtains, which had fallen through Two Floors only, and
hung on some broken Rafters in that Place, which was the
Parlour: In the Room under This, being one Pair of Stairs from
the Street, and two from the Kitchen, was Capt. <em>Collier</em> in his
Bed, and his Wife just by the Bed-side, and her Maid a little
behind her, who likewise found her self in the Kitchin a little
bruis'd, and ran out to cry for Help for her Master and Mistress,
who lay buried under the Ruins: Mrs. <em>Collier</em> was, by the timely
Aid of Neighbours who remov'd the Rubbish from her, taken out
in about Half an Hours Time, having receiv'd no Hurt but the
Fright, and an Arm a little bruis'd: Capt. <em>Collier</em> in about Half an
Hour more was likewise taken out unhurt. In the Parlour were
sitting Mr. <em>Richards</em> with his Wife, the Three Neighbours, and
the rest of his Family, a little Boy of about a Year old lying in the
Cradle, they all run out at the first Noise, and escap'd, Mrs.
<em>Richards</em> staying a little longer than the rest, to pull the Cradle
with her child in it along with her, but the House fell too suddenly
on it, and buried the Child under the Ruins, a Rafter fell on
her Foot, and bruis'd it a little, at which she likewise made her
Escape, and brought in the Neighbours, who soon uncovered the
Head of the Cradle, and cutting it off, took the Child out alive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>and well. This wonderful Preservation being worthy to be transmitted
to Posterity, we do attest to be true in every Particular.

dreadful Tempest of Wind, which has hurl'd so many Souls into
Eternity; and likewise his Providence in the miraculous Preservation

Hazards in that Hurricane: I shall here give you a short but true
Instance of the latter, which several Persons can witness besides
my self; and if you think proper may insert the same in the Book
you design for that Purpose; which is as follows. At the <em>Saracen</em>'s
Head in <em>Friday</em> Street, a Country Lad lodging three Pair of Stairs
next the Roof of the House, was wonderfully preserv'd from
Death; for about Two a Clock that <em>Saturday</em> Morning the
27th of <em>November</em>, (which prov'd fatal to so many) there fell a
Chimney upon the Roof, under which he lay, and beat it down
through the Ceiling (the Weight of the Tiles, Bricks, <em>&amp;c.</em> being
judged by a Workman to be about Five Hundred Weight) into
the Room, fell exactly between the Beds Feet and Door of the
Room, which are not Two Yards distance from each other, it
being but small: the sudden Noise awaking the Lad, he jumps out
of Bed endeavouring to find the Door, but was stopt by the
great Dust and falling of more Bricks, <em>&amp;c.</em> and finding himself
prevented, in this Fear he got into Bed again, and remain'd there
till the Day Light, (the Bricks and Tiles still falling between-whiles
about his Bed) and then got up without any Hurt, or so much as
a Tile or Brick falling on the Bed; the only thing he complain'd of
to me, was his being almost choak'd with Dust when he got out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>of Bed, or put his Head out from under the Cloaths: There was a
great Weight of Tiles and Bricks, which did not break through,
as the Workmen inform me, just over the Beds Tester, enough to
have crush'd him to Death, if they had fallen: Thus he lay safe
among the Dangers that threatned him, whilst wakeful Providence
preserv'd him. And SIR, if this be worthy your taking Notice of,
I am ready to justify the same. In Witness whereof, here is my

<p class="salutation"><em>SIR</em>,</p>

<p class="noi">The Design of your Collecting the remarkable Accidents of the
late Storm coming to my Hands, I thought my self obliged to take
this Opportunity of making a publick Acknowledgment of the
wonderful Providence of Heaven to me, namely, the Preservation
of my only Child from imminent Danger.</p>

<p>Two large Stacks of Chimneys, containing each five Funnels,
beat through the Roof, in upon the Bed where she lay, without
doing her the least Harm, the Servant who lay with her being very
much bruised. There were several Loads of Rubbish upon the Bed
before my Child was taken out of it.</p>

<p>This extraordinary Deliverance I desire always thankfully to
remember.</p>

<p>I was so nearly touch'd by this Accident, that I could not take
so much notice as I intended of this Storm; yet I observ'd the
Wind gradually to encrease from One a Clock till a Quarter after
Five, or thereabouts: at which time it seem'd to be at the highest;
when every Gust did not only return with greater Celerity, but
also with more Force.</p>

<p>From about a Quarter before Six it sensibly decreas'd. I went
often to the Door, at which times I observ'd, that every Gust was
preceded by small Flashes, which, to my Observation, did not
dart perpendicularly, but seem'd rather to skim along the Surface
of the Ground; nor did they appear to be of the same kind with
the common Light'ning Flashes.</p>

<p>I must confess I cannot help thinking that the Earth it self
suffer'd some Convulsion; and that for this Reason, because
several Springs, for the space of 48 Hours afterwards, were very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>muddy, which were never known to be so by any Storm of Wind
or Rain before: nor indeed is it possible, they lying so low, could
be affected by any thing less than a Concussion of the Earth it
self.</p>

<p>How far these small Hints may be of use to the more ingenious
Enquirers into this matter, I shall humbly leave to their Consideration,
and subscribe my self,</p>

<p class="salutation p4"><em>SIR</em>,</p>

<p class="noi">This comes to let you know that I received yours in the <em>Downs</em>,
for which I thank you. I expected to have seen you in <em>London</em>
before now, had we not met with a most violent Storm in our
way to <em>Chatham</em>. On the 27th of the last Month, about Three of
the Clock in the Morning, we lost all our Anchors and drove to
Sea: about Six we lost our Rother, and were left in a most
deplorable condition to the merciless Rage of the Wind and Seas:
we also sprung a Leak, and drove 48 Hours expecting to perish.
But it pleased God to give us a wonderful Deliverance, scarce to
be parallell'd in History; for about Midnight we were drove into
shoul Water, and soon after our Ship struck upon the Sands: the
Sea broke over us, we expected every minute that she would drop
to pieces, and that we should all be swallowed up in the Deep;
but in less than two hours time we drove over the Sands, and got
(without Rother or Pilot, or any Help but Almighty God's) into
this Place, where we run our Ship on shore, in order to save our
Lives: but it has pleased God also, far beyond our expectation, to
save our Ship, and bring us safe off again last Night. We shall
remain here a considerable while to refit our Ship, and get a new
Rother. Our Deliverance is most remarkable, that in the middle
of a dark Night we should drive over a Sand where a Ship that
was not half our Bigness durst not venture to come in the Day;
and then, without knowing where we were, drive into a narrow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>place where we have saved both Lives and Ship. I pray God give

<blockquote>

<p class="salutation p4"><em>SIR</em></p>

<p class="noi">According to the publick Notice, I send you two or three Observations
of mine upon the late dreadful Tempest: As,</p>

<p>1. In the Parish of St. <em>Mary Cray, Kent</em>, a poor Man, with his
Wife and Child, were but just gone out of their Bed, when the
Head of their House fell in upon it; which must have kill'd them.</p>

<p>2. A great long Stable in the Town, near the Church, was
blown off the Foundation entirely at one sudden Blast, from the
West-side to the East, and cast out into the High-way, over the
Heads of five Horses, and a Carter feeding them at the same time,
and not one of them hurt, nor the Rack or Manger touch'd, which
are yet standing to the Admiration of all Beholders.</p>

<p>3. As the Church at <em>Heyes</em> received great Damage, so the Spire,
with one Bell in it, were blown away over the Church yard.</p>

<p>4. The Minister of <em>South-Ash</em> had a great Deliverance from a
Chimney falling in upon his Bed just as he rose, and hurt only his
Feet; as blessed be God, our Lives have been all very miraculously
preserv'd, tho' our Buildings every where damag'd. You may
depend on all, as certify'd by me,</p>

<p class="signature">
Thomas Watts,<br />
<br />
<em>Vicar of</em> Orpington <em>and St.</em> Mary Cray.</p></blockquote>

<p class="noi">There are an innumerable variety of Deliverances, besides these,
which deserve a Memorial to future Ages; but these are noted
from the Letters, and at the Request of the Persons particularly
concern'd.</p>

<p>Particularly, 'tis a most remarkable Story of a Man belonging
to the <em>Mary</em>, a fourth Rate Man of War, lost upon the <em>Goodwin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>Sands</em>; and all the Ship's Company but himself being lost, he,
by the help of a piece of the broken Ship, got a-board the
<em>Northumberland</em>; but the Violence of the Storm continuing, the
<em>Northumberland</em> ran the same fate with the <em>Mary</em>, and coming
on shore upon the same Sand, was split to pieces by the Violence
of the Sea: and yet this Person, by a singular Providence, was
one of the 64 that were delivered by a <em>Deal Hooker</em> out of that
Ship, all the rest perishing in the Sea.</p>

<p>A poor Sailor of <em>Brighthelmston</em> was taken up after he had
hung by his Hands and Feet on the top of a Mast 48 hours, the
Sea raging so high, that no Boat durst go near him.</p>

<p>A Hoy run on shore on the Rocks in <em>Milford</em> Haven, and just
splitting to pieces (as by Captain <em>Soam</em>'s Letter) a Boat drove
by, being broke from another Vessel, with no body in it, and
came so near the Vessel, as that two Men jumpt into it, and
sav'd their Lives: the Boy could not jump so far, and was
drowned.</p>

<p>Five Sailors shifted three Vessels on an Island near the <em>Humber</em>
and were at last sav'd by a Long-boat out of the fourth.</p>

<p>A Waterman in the River of <em>Thames</em> lying asleep in the Cabbin
of a Barge, at or near <em>Black-Fryers</em>, was driven thro' Bridge in
the Storm, and the Barge went of her self into the <em>Tower-Dock</em>,
and lay safe on shore; the Man never wak'd, nor heard the
Storm, till 'twas Day; and, to his great Astonishment, he found
himself safe as above.</p>

<p>Two Boys in the <em>Poultry</em> lodging in a Garret or Upper-room,
were, by the Fall of Chimneys, which broke thro' the Floors,
carried quite to the bottom of the Cellar, and receiv'd no
Damage at all.</p>

as it pleas'd God we rid it out, we began to think all was over,
and the Bitterness of Death was past.</p>

<p>There was a great Fleet with us in the <em>Downs</em>, and several of
them were driven from their Anchors, and made the best of their
way out to Sea for fear of going on shore upon the <em>Goodwin</em>. the
Grand Fleet was just come in from the <em>Streights</em>, under Sir
<em>Cloudsly Shovel</em>; and the Great Ships being design'd for the River,
lay to Leeward: Most of the Ships that went out in the Night
appear'd in the Morning; and I think there was none known to
be lost, but one <em>Dutch</em> Vessel upon the <em>Goodwin</em>.</p>

<p>But the next Day, being <em>Friday</em>, in the Evening, it began to
gather to Windward; and as it had blown very hard all Day, at
Night the Wind freshen'd, and we all expected a stormy Night.
We saw the Men of War struck their Top-masts, and rode with
two Cables an-end: so we made all as <em>snug</em> as we could, and
prepar'd for the worst.</p>

<p>In this condition we rid it out till about 12 a-clock; when, the
Fury of the Wind encreasing, we began to see Destruction before
us: the Objects were very dreadful on every side; and tho' it was
very dark, we had Light enough to see our own Danger, and the
Danger of those near us. About One-a-clock the Ships began to
drive, and we saw several come by us without a Mast standing,
and in the utmost Distress.</p>

<p>By Two a-clock we could hear Guns firing in several Parts of
this Road, as Signals of Distress; and tho' the Noise was very
great with the Sea and Wind, yet we could distinguish plainly, in
some short Intervals, the Cries of poor Souls in Extremities.</p>

<p>By Four-a-clock we miss'd the <em>Mary</em> and the <em>Northumberland</em>,
who rid not far from us, and found they were driven from their
Anchors; but what became of them, God knows: and soon after
a large Man of War came driving down upon us, all her Masts
gone, and in a dreadful Condition. We were in the utmost Despair
at this sight, for we saw no avoiding her coming thwart <em>our
Haiser</em>: she drove at last so near us, that I was just gowing to
order the Mate to cut away, when it pleas'd God the Ship sheer'd
contrary to our Expectation to Windward, and the Man of War,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>which we found to be the <em>Sterling Castle</em>, drove clear off us, not
two Ships Lengths to Leeward.</p>

<p>It was a Sight full of terrible Particulars, to see a Ship of Eighty
Guns and about Six Hundred Men in that dismal Case; she had
cut away all her Masts, the Men were all in the Confusions of
Death and Despair; she had neither Anchor, nor Cable, nor Boat
to help her; the Sea breaking over her in a terrible Manner, that
sometimes she seem'd all under Water; and they knew, as well as
we that saw her, that they drove by the Tempest directly for the
<em>Goodwin</em>, where they could expect nothing but Destruction: The
Cries of the Men, and the firing their Guns, One by One, every
Half Minute for Help, terrified us in such a Manner, that I think
we were half dead with the Horror of it.</p>

<p>All this while we rid with two Anchors a-head, and in great
Distress: To fire Guns for Help, I saw was to no Purpose, for if
any Help was to be had, there were so many other Objects for it,
that we could not expect it, and the Storm still encreasing.</p>

<p>Two Ships, a-head of us, had rid it out till now, which was
towards Five in the Morning, when they both drove from their
Anchors, and one of them coming foul of a small <em>Pink</em>, they
both sunk together; the other drove by us, and having one Mast
standing, I think it was her Main-Mast, she attempted to spread
a little Peak of her Sail, and so stood away before it; I suppose she
went away to Sea.</p>

<p>At this time, the Raging of the Sea was so violent, and the
Tempest doubled its Fury in such a Manner, that my Mate told
me, we had better go away to Sea, for 'twould be impossible to
ride it out; I was not of his Opinion, but was for cutting my Masts
by the Board, which at last we did, and parted with them with
as little Damage as could be expected, and we thought she rid
easier for it by a great deal; and I believe, had it blown two Hours
longer, we should have rid it out, having two new Cables out,
and our best Bower and Sheet Anchor down: But about Half an
Hour after Five to Six, it blew, if it be possible to conceive it so,
as hard again as it had done before, and first our best Bower
Anchor came Home, the Mate, who felt it give way, cried out, we
are all undone, for the Ship drove; I found it too true, and, upon
as short a Consultation as the Time would admit, we concluded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>to put out to Sea before we were driven too far to Leeward, when
it would be impossible to avoid the <em>Goodwin</em>.</p>

<p>So we slipt our Sheet Cable, and sheering the Ship towards the
Shore, got her Head about, and stood away afore it; Sail we had
none, nor Mast standing: Our Mate had set up a Jury Missen
but no Canvass could bear the Fury of the Wind, yet he fasten'd
an old Tarpaulin so as that it did the Office of a Missen and kept
us from driving too fast to Leeward.</p>

<p>In this Condition we drove out of the <em>Downs</em>, and past so near
the <em>Goodwin</em>, that we could see several great Ships fast a ground,
and beating to Pieces. We drove in this desperate Condition till
Day-break, without any Abatement of the Storm, and our Men
heartless and dispirited, tir'd with the Service of the Night, and
every Minute expecting Death.</p>

<p>About 8 a Clock, my Mate told me, he perceiv'd the Wind to
abate; but it blew still such a Storm, that if we had not had a very
tite Ship, she must have founder'd, as we were now farther off at
Sea, and by my Guess might be in the mid Way between <em>Harwich</em>
and the <em>Brill</em>, the Sea we found run longer, and did not break so
quick upon us as before, but it ran exceeding high, and we having
no Sail to keep us to rights, we lay wallowing in the Trough of
the Sea in a miserable Condition: We saw several Ships in the
same Condition with our selves, but could neither help them, nor
they us; and one we saw founder before our Eyes, and all the
People perish'd.</p>

<p>Another dismal Object we met with, which was an open Boat
full of Men, who, as we may suppose, had lost their Ship; any
Man may suppose, what Condition a Boat must be in, if we were
in so bad a Case in a good Ship: we were soon tost out of their
Sight, and what became of them any one may guess; if they had
been within Cables Length of us we could not have help'd them.</p>

<p>About Two a Clock in the Afternoon, the Wind encreased
again, and we made no doubt it would prove as bad a Night as
before; but that Gust held not above Half an Hour.</p>

<p>All Night it blew excessive hard, and the next Day, which was
Sabbath Day, about Eleven a Clock it abated, but still blew hard:
about three it blew something moderately, compar'd with the
former; and we got up a Jury Main-Mast, and rigg'd it as well as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>we could, and with a Main Sail lower'd almost to the Deck, stood
at a great Rate afore it all Night and the next Day, and on <em>Tuesday</em>
Morning we saw Land, but could not tell where it was; but being
not in a Condition to keep the Sea, we run in, and made Signals
of Distress; some Pilots came off to us, by whom we were inform'd
we had reached the Coast of <em>Norway</em>, and having neither Anchor
nor Cable on board capable to ride the Ship, a <em>Norweigian</em> Pilot
came on board, and brought us into a Creek where we had smooth
Water, and lay by till we got Help, Cables, and Anchors, by which
means we are safe in Place.</p>

Yarmouth <em>Roads during the great Storm, but
now in the River of</em> Thames.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="salutation"><em>SIR</em>,</p>

<p class="noi">Hearing of your good Design of preserving the Memory of the
late Dreadful Storm for the Benefit of Posterity, I cannot let you
want the Particulars as happen'd to us on board our Ship.</p>

<p>We came over the Bar of <em>Tinmouth</em> about the &mdash;&mdash; having had
terrible blowing Weather for almost a Week, insomuch that we
were twice driven back almost the Length of <em>Newcastle</em>, with
much Difficulty and Danger we got well over that, and made the
<em>High-land</em> about <em>Cromer</em> on the North-side of <em>Norfolk</em>; here it
blew so hard the <em>Wednesday</em> Night before, that we could not
keep the Sea, nor fetch the Roads of <em>Yarmouth</em>; but as the Coast
of <em>Norfolk</em> was a Weather-shore, we hall'd as close <em>Cromer</em> as
we durst lie, the Shore there being very flat; here we rode <em>Wednesday</em>
and <em>Thursday</em>, the 24th and 25th of <em>November</em>.</p>

<p>We could not reckon our selves safe here, for as this is the most
dangerous Place between <em>London</em> and <em>Newcastle</em>, and has been
particularly fatal to our Colliers, so we were very uneasy; I considered
that when such Tempestuous Weather happen'd, as this
seem'd to threaten, nothing is more frequent than for the Wind
to shift Points; and if it should have blown half the Wind from
the South East, as now blew from the South West, we must have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>gone a-shore there, and been all lost for being embayed; there we
should have had no putting out to Sea, nor staying there.</p>

<p>This Consideration made me resolve to be gon, and thinking
on <em>Friday</em> Morning the Wind slacken'd a little, I weigh'd and
stood away for <em>Yarmouth</em> Roads; and with great Boating and
Labour got into the Roads about One in the Afternoon, being a
little after Flood, we found a very great Fleet in the Roads; there
was above Three Hundred Sail of Colliers, not reckoning above
Thirty Sail which I left behind me, that rode it out thereabouts,
and there was a great Fleet just come from <em>Russia</em>, under the
Convoy of the <em>Reserve</em> Frigate, and Two other Men of War; and
about a Hundred Sail of Coasters, <em>Hull</em>-Men, and such small
Craft.</p>

<p>We had not got to an Anchor, moor'd, and set all to Rights,
but I found the Wind freshen'd, the Clouds gather'd, and all
look'd very black to Windward; and my Mate told me, he wish'd
he had staid where we were, for he would warrant it we had a
blowing Night of it.</p>

<p>We did what we could to prepare for it, struck our Top-mast,
and slung our Yards, made all tite and fast upon Deck; the Night
prov'd very dark, and the Wind blew a Storm about Eight a
Clock, and held till Ten, when we thought it abated a little, but
at Eleven it freshen'd again, and blew very hard; we rid it out very
well till Twelve, when we veer'd out more Cable, and in about
Half an Hour after, the Wind encreasing, let go our Sheet Anchor;
by One a Clock it blew a dreadful Storm, and though our Anchors
held very well, the Sea came over us in such a vast Quantity, that
we was every Hour in Danger of Foundring: About Two a Clock
the Sea fill'd our Boat as she lay upon the Deck, and we was glad
to let her go over board for Fear of staving in our Decks: Our
Mate would then have cut our Mast by the Board, but I was not
willing, and told him, I thought we had better slip our Cables,
and go out to Sea, he argued she was a deep Ship, and would not
live in the Sea, and was very eager for cutting away the Mast; but
I was loth to part with my Mast, and could not tell where to run
for Shelter if I lost them.</p>

<p>About Three a Clock abundance of Ships drove away, and
came by us; some with all their Masts gone, and foul of one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>another; in a sad Condition my Men said they saw Two founder'd
together, but I was in the Cabin, and cannot say I saw it. I saw a
<em>Russia</em> Ship come foul of a Collier, and both drove away together
out of our Sight, but I am told since the <em>Russia</em> Man sunk by her
Side.</p>

<p>In this Condition we rid till about Three a Clock, the <em>Russia</em>
Ships which lay a-head of me, and the Men of War, who lay
a-head of them, fir'd their Guns for Help, but 'twas in vain to
expect it; the Sea went too high for any Boat to live. About
Five, the Wind blew at that prodigious Rate, that there was no
Possibility of riding it out, and all the Ships in the Road seem'd
to us to drive: Yet still our Anchors held it, and I began to think
we should ride it out there, or founder; when a Ship's long Boat
came driving against us, and gave such a Shock on the Bow that
I thought it must have been a Ship come foul of us, and expected
to sink all at once; our Men said there was some people in the
Boat, but as the Sea went so high no Man dust stand upon the
Fore-castle, so no Body could be sure of it; the Boat stav'd to
pieces with the Blow, and went away, some on One Side of us
and some on the other; but whether our Cable receiv'd any
Damage by it or not we cannot tell, but our Sheet Cable gave
Way immediately, and as the other was not able to hold us alone,
we immediately drove; we had then no more to do, but to put
afore the Wind, which we did: it pleased God by this Time the
Tide of Ebb was begun, which something abated the Height of
the Sea, but still it went exceeding high; we saw a great many
Ships in the same Condition with our selves, and expecting every
Moment to sink in the Sea. In this Extremity we drove till Daylight
when we found the Wind abated, and we stood in for the Shore,
and coming under the Lee of the <em>Cliff</em> near <em>Scarbro</em>, we got so
much Shelter, as that our small Bower Anchors would ride us.</p>

<p>I can give you no Account but this; but sure such a Tempest
never was in the World. They say here, that of Eighty Sail in
<em>Grimsby</em> Road, they can hear of but Sixteen; yet the rest are all
blown away, Here is about Twelve or Fourteen Sail of Ships come
in to this Place, and more are standing in for the Shore.</p>

Abundance of other strange Deliverances have been related, but
with so small Authority as we dare not convey them into the
World under the same Character with the rest; and have therefore
chose to omit them.</p>

<h2><em>The Conclusion</em></h2>

<p class="noi">The Editor of this Book has labour'd under some Difficulties in
this Account: and one of the chief has been, how to avoid too
many Particulars, the Crowds of Relations which he has been
oblig'd to lay by to bring the Story into a Compass tolerable to
the Reader.</p>

<p>And tho' some of the Letters inserted are written in a homely
Stile, and exprest after the Country Fashion from whence they
came, the Author chose to make them speak their own Language,
rather than by dressing them in other Words make the
Authors forget they were their own.</p>

<p>We receiv'd a Letter, very particular, relating to the Bishop of
<em>Bath</em> and <em>Wells</em>, and reflecting upon his Lordship for some
Words he spoke, <em>That he had rather have his Brains knock'd
out, than</em> &amp;c. relating to his Inferiour Clergy. The Gentleman
takes the Disaster for a Judgment of God on him: But as in his
Letter the Person owns himself the Bishop's Enemy, fills his
Letter with some Reflexions indecent, at least for us: and at last,
tho' he dates from <em>Somerton</em>, yet baulks setting his Name to his
Letter: for these Reasons we could not satisfie to record the
Matter, and leave a Charge on the Name of that unfortunate
Gentleman, which, he being dead, could not answer, and we
alive could not prove. And on these Accounts hope the Reverend
Gentleman who sent the Letter will excuse Us.</p>

<p>Also we have omitted, tho' our List of Particulars promis'd
such a thing, An Account of some unthinking Wretches, who
pass'd over this dreadful Judgment with Banter, Scoffing, and
Contempt. 'Tis a Subject ungrateful to recite, and full of Horror
to read; and we had much rather cover such Actions with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>general Blank in Charity to the Offenders, and in hopes of their
Amendment.</p>

<p>One unhappy Accident I cannot omit, and which is brought
us from good Hands, and happen'd in a Ship homeward bound
from the <em>West-Indies</em>. The Ship was in the utmost Danger of
Foundring; and when the Master saw all, as he thought, lost,
his Masts gone, the Ship leaky, and expecting her every moment
to sink under him, fill'd with Despair, he calls to him the Surgeon
of the Ship, and by a fatal Contract, as soon made as hastily
executed, they resolv'd to prevent the Death they fear'd by
one more certain; and going into the Cabbin, they both shot
themselves with their Pistols. It pleas'd God the Ship recover'd
the Distress, was driven safe into —— and the Captain just liv'd
to see the desperate Course he took might have been spar'd; the
Surgeon died immediately.</p>

<p>There are several very remarkable Cases come to our Hands
since the finishing this Book, and several have been promis'd
which are not come in; and the Book having been so long
promis'd, and so earnestly desir'd by several Gentlemen that
have already assisted that way, the Undertakers could not prevail
with themselves to delay it any longer.</p>
